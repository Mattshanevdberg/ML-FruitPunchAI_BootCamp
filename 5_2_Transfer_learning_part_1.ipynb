This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday\", ' Florida birds: I love my nature guide to Florida birds. We have identified many birds using this invaluable tool. You can too!', \" Better than I remembered it!: Read the John Carter of Mars series back in junior high school. I remembered the violence of the culture created by ERB in that series and the concept of honor in battle, but I had forgotten that there were underlying messages relating to family values, honesty, integrity, trust, the individual's right to seek success, the strength to stand up for one's own beliefs. While the storyline definitely is somewhat thin, the book reads easily and leaves no loose ends. Didn't see the recent movie that came out based on the series; kind of glad that I didn't. It was fun venturing back into that realm of imagination that only books can provide.\", ' I just wanted Jimmy Ponder (too little guitar on this one): I couldn\\'t wait to get this CD,being a guitarist myself.

Too bad I couldn\\'t have listened to cuts first, I would not have bought this CD. Sorry! The cuts of just Jimmy are great though, but too few .... :(', ' Not so Funny people!: Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don\\'t think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow\\'s ensemble doesn\\'t seem to work with Sandler\\'s schtick. I loved \"Knocked Up\" and \"40 Year Old Virgin\" but there doesn\\'t seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for \"Bruno\" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I\\'m so glad I only rented it.', ' bench: The bench is very nice.

It\\'s the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters\\' names are all so similar it\\'s impossible to keep track of who\\'s who, but who cares, because the author doesn\\'t give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It\\'s business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet.

This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money.\", ' Bad purchase: This is not a very good toy.

As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn\\'t. Luckily we now have James Cameron\\'s film \"Titanic\" to build what Pellegrino couldn\\'t.', \" Bratz Helmet: When I ordered this product, I didn't see a size chart and I was sent a size that is not suitable for the purpose intended.\", \" Such a boring toy: I purchased this slot machine thinking it was larger than it was and also hoping it would at least perform a little better than it did.

Reading this book today one wonders how a writer 50 years ago could have so much insight into the society we live in today.Yes its about censorship, but its also about today\\'s media and advertising culture. People are fed the news and told what opinion they should have about it... why bother thinking yourself?The parts of the book about television and how the media ties into law enforcement are chilling, in light of the new \"Amber Alerts\" adopted across the country.Good books make you think about your world, and this one makes you wonder how Bradbury could have known.The afterward (or coda) was priceless, and its comments on censorship and \"editing\" are far more frightening than people showing up to burn your books.\"I will not go gently onto a shelf, degutted, to become a non-book.\"', ' Great story sorriest printing and binding Ive ever witnessed: The story , of course , is fabulous but this is the worst binding I have ever seen in 30+ years of reading paperbacks.

Sorry, but this was a stinker. The battle sequences were OK, but they weren\\'t enough to overcome the shallow & predictable \"plot\"--there were these incredibly long, boring stretches where the cardboard characters kind of looked at each other and muttered horribly cliche, stale dialogue.

We found it very helpful! I loved that I could go back to it and watch certain parts over again to refresh my memory. If we had gone to a class, I wouldn't have had that luxury. Once I went into labor, I knew exactly what to do and I was able to make it without any drugs. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD.

The characters are a dynamic mix that make the story had to put down. You develop and understanding for the villian were you empathize with him while at the same time you feel for the hero and heroine to catch him. A must read for those who like suspense novels.', ' Just Plain Cruel Will Do: I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book.', \" Just like the hospital and doc's clinic: I bought 3 other types of thermometers -temporal scan, auxuliary thermometer (but), oral thermometer, but was getting tired of guessing her temperature.

However, really liked them and I couldn't get the song, (Till) I Kissed You, out of my head. So I bought the CD for my girlfriend, come to find out they have a lot of songs that we liked and had heard, but never really paid that much attention too and didn't know that they sung them.

It is far from that to be sure. Sure there are alot of songs here but they are all old demo\\'s or just poorly recorded live stuff from garage practices & small clubs. Maybe I\\'m just too jaded, but the sound quality was horrible. I mean I was disapointed in it not being studio recordings in the 1st place. But in this day & age you should be able to go in & clean the really poor sound quality up a bit before packaging it up & selling it to the general public. It basicly sounds like it was recorded usuing a portable cassette tape player, & a cheap one at that!

The plot is weak, the script is empty, and the acting is subdued. Well, what do you expect from a movie that has Zeta Jones in it? Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn\\'t allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film.

The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio.', ' Great travel guide to Europe!: This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect.

As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!', ' a shattering ending to a rather slow book: Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like \"Animal Farm\" better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself.', \" Nigel Planer brings Discworld to life: If you're read one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, you don't need to know this is a fantastic read. But Planer's narration also does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life. The accents and voices are wonderful!

It is easy to fix when it does jam up, but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good (just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using!) and it does print quietly and is easy to operate.

But I think that's just the power of the book; because the state, as talked about in the book,is an extreme example, but I think that extremes show the real danger of something; it makes you more aware of a situation (a state form, a social question etc.) than a report based on real facts does. therefore you also shouldn't take this book for real, but you should take parts of this books and compare them to reality. and by doing so you'll find a lot of things that form, as described in the book, dangers in present day society also. this book actually shows all what totalitarianism can lead to, and therefore enables you to see the danger of it\", ' Enhanced with music and sound effects: The first in Scenario Productions\\' \"The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes\" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story.

It comes at this issue from a particularly Reformational angle. What does that mean? He grounds his thesis in the way of looking at the world rediscovered during the Protestant Reformation: creation, fall, and redemption. When we consider life everything is considered from this biblical viewpoint. What Wolters presets is a great introduction to three points that can radically change the way we think and live. If you are looking for a worldview book that is heavy on applicable, biblical content rather than a rant about how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket this it the book for you.', \" A nice abridgement: These comments are for the Freddie Jones reading of Hound for Penguin Audiobooks. It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back. However -- it's a very good abridgement; unless you know the story practically line by line, the cuts are very unobtrusive. My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete. Freddie Jones gives it a very good reading, absolutely drenched in Victorian gothic atmosphere. I would recommend it.\", \" Just because she couldn't do it: Doesn't mean other women can't.

There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book.

Realizing that the light would be more useful than the fan. Where I was camping the nights were cold and the fan was not necessary.

The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it.', ' Self-indulgent drivel: I purchased this book looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the \"inner game\" of preparing for Everest, but I didn\\'t.', \" really low quality: i bought this product when my original ac adapter was destroyed by my dog. even at the price i paid, this was an awful product. most of the time i had to spend forever to jiggle the connecter into my mac to get it to even stay connected, and then it would just spontaneously stop charging and i have to jiggle again. it's awful! i never had any problem like that w/ my original mac ac adapter. it's gotten so frustrating that i think i'm going to take a hammer and smash it into pieces. and technical support doesn't reply my inquiries. do NOT buy this product, even if it seems cheap! stay away from it! look around on craigslist and buy a used adapter instead. this adapter is garbage\", \" Great little mp3: I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player!

I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the \"gems\" I forgot about.', \" Time to quit series!: I have read each Bed & Breakfast thru #25. I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years. Judith has turned into a doormat.On the plus side, I have read most of the Alpine Series, and so far they are delightful. But I will pass on the Bed & Breakfast series from now on.\", \" Beware, this isn't a new book.: I was pretty disappointed when I purchased this book because I thought it was the next book in the series. Instead it is just a compilation of the previous 3 books one after another.\", ' Disappointing: One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song \"Mi Cara de Pared,\" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It\\'s almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I\\'ll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer.', ' Dance album of the year!: Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year.

Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better.

Bad software driver!!!\", ' Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.', ' Video cable: This was the perfect cable to upload my videos from my Sony video camcorder to my PC.

The FIRST one we returned thinking it was broken but soon realized with the SECOND one that we just weren't shaking it hard or long enough. After a week of trying to figure this thing out, the screen has gone fuzzy and even a new battery could not revive it. Even our 8 year old is disgusted and frustrated with the quality of this toy. It is going back tomorrow - at our son's request. If your little boy wants this toy, please show him this review and suggest he pick something else. It's just an expensive disappointment. Please read the review by Diane. She says it so much better than we ever could.\", \" pure formula junk: This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist.\", \" An exquisitely written adventure!: I have read these books to the point of wearing out my paperbacks. Ayla is the role model I never had as a young girl and sets a high standard for all of us to attain. I was completely transported to a different place and time while I read each story and felt drawn toward these marvelously written characters. I am so anxious for Ms. Auel's next creation I cannot pass a bookstore, anywhere, without checking to see if it's in yet. Please hurry, Jean!\", \" Not A Great Book By Any Means, But Well Written: Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them.\", \" Worthless: It should have got 0 rating. You could buy a English-French dictionary instead of buying this. This does not 'teach' you anything. Do not spend your heard earned money on this\", \" It hardly puts out any air: I can't recommend this fan simply because the output is so weak it doesn't actually get any thing done.

I wouldn\\'t have mind if they at least put the theatrical version on video too... bet they didn\\'t! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?', \" Why 5 stars? Because there's no 6th: A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce.

Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint.\", ' First Knight (Cassette): Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again.', \" Stunning!: I plan on taking some pictures of this ring because the one picture for the description is beautiful but leaves a lot to the imagination.The blue isn't as green as the picture shows, and it's a little lighter, but it's otherwise very close to the color shown. It's a very beautiful ring! The silver is stunningly bright and shiny. Size is perfect. The stone is very high, though, which is hard to tell from the picture. But I've never had a solitaire ring with a rock this big, so I bet that it has to be this tall.All in all, it's an absolutely beautiful ring, especially considering the price.\", \" Hollywood has run out of ideas......: I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!\", \" What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6: The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.\", ' material is great: love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable ,material is soft great price would definely recommend product', ' It must be good...: I tried it out and fell asleep on it. No noticeable leakage overnight. It seems to me like a good buy.', \" Great!: Great Door knocker. It has a very clean look to it and the peep hole isn't obvious.

Other than that, it looks very professional.\", \" Good performances: I bought this CD because it's one of the few complete recordings of the Suite In Modo Polonico. The sound quality is good, and the guitar tone is good as well. I thought the tempos of the Suite were a little fast, but otherwise, a nice CD reference of Tansman's work.\", ' big disappointment: I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can\\'t believe all the \"5 star\" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection.

Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics: We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.\", ' itchy: I washed it before used it for the first time.

Any other version.: Who told Antonio Banderas he could sing? He can't. Madonna can but could only sing this score, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's good ones (and they are becoming rare items), if Hollywood had it lowered for her. This does spoil the balance of the musical, but Hollywood doesn't care about things like that. They also gave her a song belonging to another character which makes no dramatic sense whatsoever. Hollywood doesn't care about things like that, either.There are many recordings of the stage musical available. Buy one of those instead.\", ' Classic Sci-Fi: I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov\\'s \"Foundation series\" novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but \"Foundation and Empire\" moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development.', ' Grainy, CC only with WMP: This set has a very limited menu - set-up has only audio selection. Most series DVDs allow a \"play all\" option when several episodes are on a platter, this does not.The appearance of the video is slightly grainy, with slight ghosting outlines.This is another set of DVDs which have to be played in your computer\\'s DVD tray with Windows Media Player, not in a DVD player box, in order to access Closed Captioning. Amazon needs to make that distinction in the descriptions of the DVDs it sells. Hunkering over a computer display is not my preferred method of watching TV.On a positive note, the DVD carrier is the easiest I\\'ve been able to pop a disk out of.', \" You don't have to know hockey: One of the things that I like best about these movies (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn't follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these movies and even learn something. I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value. There is a reason why the Mighty Ducks movies keep getting repeated on Australian TV - they are inoffensive, pure entertainment.\", ' It\\'s \"OK\" but not as good as the first two.: Bought it because it was part of the series and I really enjoy Shai LeBouf as an actor. Really liked him in Disturbia and in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (although the plot of that movie was pretty lame. but that\\'s for another review.) Disappointed with how they explained the absence of his true love, Mikeala, and why they broke up. For him to have a model as a girlfriend seemed a bit of a reach. She lacked the toughness that spurred the character of Sam (Shai) to do great things. This movie is on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 for story line and a 7 for action. I still bought it but am kinda disappointed.', \" Intex Pillow Rest Twin AirBed: This bed was purchased as a spare bed for short time visitors as we are limited in space in our Park Model RV. We needed someting that didn't take up much room to store and yet was comfortable enough so that as person could get a decent nights sleep on it. After reading all the reviews I could find, I deduced that some of these beds were faulty (like all things) and that they tended to deflate overnight, but, that most were fine. Our bed has met all of our expectations and is fine, comfortable and holds the air. I would highly recommend this product!!\", \" Autoawesome!: Haven't watched in 3d yet, but we all loved it at the movies, don't know what was up with Megan Fox picking Cowboys and Aliens over this movie. Even though it was a good movie it just didn't have that iconic childhood following to be a blockbuster. This is a must have in your collection.\", ' Sheer madness, meticulously documented: Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called \"Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It.\" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I\\'d be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca.

The tension and psychosis which built but never held interest, created empathy, or suspended self, finally erupted into a confusing condonning of rape. This is one of those ugly movies that defiles the consciousness of its viewers with no higher purpose - artistic or philosophic. Your time would be better spent watching lint form in the dryer.', ' This is HIGH DEFINITION!: A wonderful, exciting adventure in the best HD I\\'ve seen so far. Whomever said any of these movies was \"grainy\" didn\\'t watch it on a TV as good as my Mitsubishi Diamond Series.The story was great and endearing, the casting was great, Spiderman was perfect and the HD was breataking.This is what good movies are all about: telling a story, using artistic means to do it, and have a great cast to do it.And, of course, the ending was great too.', \" Not just disappointed, angered.: It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames.\", ' Shakespeare\\'s best!: I love this play. The words are so beautiful, and the story never fails to draw me in. And I must admit that the language is hard to understand - but the New Folger Library is the way to go. I love them! They make it so easy and understandable for all of us who don\\'t say \"wherefore\" for why. So if the language is intimidating you get the New Folger Library. But getting back to the play itself, it is fantastic, and something that everyone should read.', \" Bad movie? You're soaking in it: Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of.

I\\'m sorry, but this book is just DISTURBING. I couldn\\'t even bring myself to finish it. The plot was confusing, the characters were dull, and the idea is to horrid to contemplate. The \"hero\", Guy Montag, is a strange man in the beginning, and becomes a fugitive murderer later on. Unless you want to see an awful, bleak look into the future, DO NOT READ FAHRENHEIT 451!', \" Heart's Capitol debut is a smash hit!: In 1985,Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983,following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefall,whose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs:WHAT ABOUT LOVE is a hard-rocker featuring Starship's Grace Slick on background vocals. IF LOOKS COULD KILL was a minor hit. NEVER is another hard-rocker. THESE DREAMS is considered adult comtemporary. NOTHING AT ALL sounds cool. All the other songs are very good.\", \" Marine Comedy: This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh.\", \" good, cheap product: This product is about half the price of that offered from apple.

Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it.

They're most likely a sick joke by RDJ.\", ' Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book: I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can\\'t sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the \"hidden gems\" will be missed if there are any.

Horizont\\'s \"Silent Moon\" is a classic New Age album from 1986. It was readily available for a few years, then totally disappeared; this disc is EXTREMELY hard to find now. This album is a good mix of new age and \"space jazz\". Most of the synths used here are now obsolete, and they sound great. The title track is definitely the outstanding track on the disc, but others are great as well. If you were to compare to other artists, it would be kind of like combining Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, and Dave Grusin (the more jazzy tracks are Grusin-esque). Overall a good listen and a great representation of the greatest era in new age music. Too bad the cover art is not available here, it\\'s awesome. If I get a chance I will scan my copy and post it.

Has 3 lock tite latches on outside and 3 holes for pad locks for when you travel. Is airline approved. My husband has not has a chance to take it on a plane yet so not known how it would stand up, but my 1 1/2 yr. old twins liked to knock it over and stand on it a lot when it was within their reach. So I think it would hold up well for air travel if it could stand 2 kids without damaging the bow inside. Very good case for the cheap price.', ' Unique presentation of the vampire genre: This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully \"out\". Living people (referred to as \"warm\") flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker\\'s DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won\\'t be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I\\'m rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON).', \" Best Book by Asimov (fiction): I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best.

I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy.\", ' Poor quality control: I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect. After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe. It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt. At first, I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots. However, it did not help, and my foot continued to hurt. Today, I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size, and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion. I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all, my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold. 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control.', ' This book should be on our shelves as Pastors: I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series.

This is a very good book, whose only shortcoming is a lack of information. The first sections are shorter than I would have liked them, and the subsequent sections, though fascinating reading, are of limited usefulness to anyone who is not a rich globetrotter.Still, there is a lot of great info in those shop descriptions, but you have to glean it all out.

It's funky,lush,melodic,hard hitting and has the musical integrity that many Cds that try to be commercial don't have.I played this for my 17 year old son and he just loved it.The music has the ability to speak to alot of different audiences and age groups.I love the track Voices on The Corner.

First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can\\'t stay awake to find it, what\\'s the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient.

Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club).

I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about 300 pages. Its the reason why kids these days hate reading, because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter. The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead. In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life. Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death. Now I know there wasn't much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn't think it was this bad. He drags on a plot that shouldn't of lasted more than 30 pages into a whole freakin novel!

I thoroughly enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi, not just Stargate fans.', \" This is why censorship stinks!: This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books.

When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother.

At first when I was reading it, it seemed a little boring because it wasn't the type of book I usually enjoy reading. But after I got about 20 pages in, I couldn't put it down!

(Really, how complicated can a power adaptor be?)PRO: It is solid white (although the picture makes it seem not to be) just most like apple products and it does the simple task of powering my PowerBook.CON: It does not have the LED lighting at the base like the OEM does, but this is only a small loss.This is a great value minded replacement.

The creativity behind everything from the plot twists, to the music (the soundtrack, by the way, is fantastic!), to the animated cut-ins, to the soccer analogy absolutely blew me away! This movie is pure fun and excitement; don't miss it!\", \" BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!!: I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it.\", \" A Great Find!: It is fantastic for me, as for any huge Universal Horror fan, to find the wonderful music of Frank Skinner available on CD. Since I was a child watching these movies, I've always thought that Skinner's strings added enormously to the thrill factor in the Holmes series,'The Wolfman', 'Son of Frankenstein', etc. The instantly recognizable Universal Studio opening theme always made me run to see what was on. A true must-have addition for the classic horror collector!\", ' \"It was a dark and stormy night\": John Keel\\'s \"The Mothman Prophecies\" follows a usual form for ufology books: He presents a large collection of anecdotes, personal observations and experiences, mixes it with some debunking to woo the scientific mind, and throws in some ancient gods and goddesses, references to fairies, and a variety of religious \"sightings\". This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown\\'s standard beginning for tales, \"It was a dark and stormy night.\"Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest. Men in Black? Saucer shaped vehicles with diamond-shaped windows? \"Thyroid-like eyes\"? If this gets your attention, you\\'ll enjoy \"The Mothman Prophecies.\"The recent movie is based only loosely on Keel\\'s research, by the way, and will fail to satisfy informed ufology readers.', \" A little hard to fold back up but seems great otherwise: I'm arranging a getaway weekend in hotel, so I bought a bunch of these.

Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!?

Despite the fact that it was orriginaly an inditement against Stalinism, it is still relevant in 21st century America.The nature of the \"War on Terror\" could have been taken dirrectly from the book, in places word for word.

From the very beginning, the book captures you into the lives of the murderers, victims, and prosecutors. It does a remarkable job at building the story line so that you are not overwhelmed with information, but are still well informed with details and specifics. I also loved that the book went into the past of Charles Manson and the \"family\". Over all this was an EXCELLENT book, and it was very hard to put down!!', \" Ryan's Daughter DVD: We were disappointed that this DVD would not play on our regular DVD player.

It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you\\'d better come to love the phrases \"save successful\" and \"load successful\" because that\\'s what you\\'ll do, over and over and over! It\\'s completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it!

My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem.', ' fine non itunes player: For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine. The item has to be clipped down otherwise it slips off. A worthwhile buy for the gym. Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer. The big negative: your computer has to stay on for 4 hours during the initial charge; if the computer goes to sleep the player stops charging. Same for subsequent charging.', ' Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure: I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone.', \" Very authentic: This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.\", \" Easy to setup and comfortable: I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints.\", \" Actually, this book is not worth one star.: This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book.\", ' Molly Myers: Molly Myers, in her review of \"My Name is Rachel Corrie,\" describes the ISM as \"an organization dedicated to non-violence.\" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM \"pacifists\" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they\\'re perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep \"innocent Palestinians\" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly\\'s reviews; they are biased in the extreme.', \" Excellent Product, Fast Shipping: Scott's Cakes contacted me after receiving my previous order.

That is not true. I have got a rewiew of \"we\" that Orwell wrote in 1947. Besides, I have read a danish translation of Samjatins novel, and there are loads of parralels. But still I regard 1984 as one of the greatest, and most visionary, novels of modern times.', ' Milk It: Some Of The Box: Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. The review title represents exactly how I feel about this disc. One can\\'t pretend that this disc is anything but a quest for more money, and some will agree with me that this doesn\\'t even represent the box very well at all. This is one of those discs that, if you are a die-hard collector, you would buy, but most collectors already have the box anyway, so that makes you less likely to buy this one. Also, if you weren\\'t a big fan and you bought the disc actually thinking it was the \"best\", it wouldn\\'t give an accurate overview of the box and you\\'d probably become uninterested. So basically, if you must have the few extras, find it cheap or used, and if you\\'re a first timer, let this be the last thing you add to your collection. It\\'s been said a few times already, but just get the box and make your own comp. Why buy the milk when you can get the whole cow for...a little more?', ' I didn\\'t catch the catch: This is a stage play!

Nevertheless, a stage play is not what I thought I was paying for.', ' Confusion. Intrepidation. Asphyxiation.: In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere.', \" Hardly worth the whole $2.95 I paid for them.: I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone.\", \" Robocop dressed like Lara Croft: I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame.\", \" The Worst!: A complete waste of time.

It lookes exactly like the ones on the show. The battle chips are great too. The only thing I can say is bad is that it olny comes with three chips and as of now there is no way of getting any, unless u buy a figure (...), you can get 1 battle chip per figure.

But the real \"excellence\" is in the acting.', ' Bad Design, just buy the figures: We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas.

Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it.

They must have thought the book was THE ONLY RESOURCE they would need. I used this book and I did pass the exam. It wasn't the only resource I used though.The publishers of the book even claim that using only this book will not help you pass the exam. It is an OVERVIEW text. It is a primer to help you delve into the material. This book will not substitute the large amount of qualitative reading and equation memorization that you'll need to do in order to pass.I give it a 4 mainly because the book does what it claims and because some of the more negative reviews are too far-fetched. Remember to buy the version that applies to your test year.\", ' Probably The Best Canadian release in this decade!!!!: Less than a year ago I saw maybe a 30 sec. of one of her songs on MuchMusic, and I was...amased.

I\\'m allways on the lookout for interesting artists, being one myself, and I\\'ve been involved in the music industry for a long time working in a recording studio. I can\\'t tell you \"Buy This\" because I think it is great-that\\'s a personal opinion. But I can tell you \"Buy this\" because I like it and so will you, and anyone else you play it to. And if you ever have a chance to see her perform live, DO IT. It was the most intimate performance I ever saw artist deliver on stage. And her band shines with her.', ' Over a hundred pages of wonderful solitude: I read this book in my freshman year of college. I loved it. It has many characters that flow together. The story has a magical realism to it. Characters die and come back to life, people live for years on end. It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go.

The story is poor, and even when it has great artists, they become secondary to the story. It is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and it is basically because of the lack of arguments behind the story.After choosing it, my girlfriend banned me for six months of choosing the movie to see togheter. (And I think I deserved it)', \" The graphics were good, that's about it.: I am not a professional movie critic, but I love movies. This was a poorly written movie and that's why I gave it two stars. The focus for this movie was clearly to make money utilizing graphics and taking advantage of a strong fan base. After watching it, I understand why Megan Fox turned down the opportunity to be in it. I would give you examples from the movies as to why it was so horrible, but let's just say it was that forgettable.\", \" A bunch of CGI crap.....: The girl who replaces Megan Fox wears white the ENTIRE MOVIE, it borderlines stupidity. The movie is just garbage, I'm not gonna waste your time telling you every bad detail, but it almost seems that several things were done just to piss Megan Fox off completely ignoring story line.\", \" Good for a laugh: I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed.

I came to the conclusion that an individual who rarely reads fiction and who is an engineer by training could probably never \"get\" something like this book. It almost seems that the technique of the writer fascinates many of the readers perhaps more than the substance. The magical realism style is too much for me.

But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a \"Mediterranean\" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichés and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist.

Orwell's insight into the nature of governments is amazing and enlightening. He has this detached, slightly pessimistic attitude toward human nature that I love. He is so frank about man's selfishness and greed -- not only as it relates to the governments in 1984, but also to the rebels like Winston who, in the end, care only for themselves. There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness. He described the society, the history and, most of all, the language of the futuristic Oceania in such detail. 1984 is truly a masterpiece.\", ' The story was very interesting and the book worth reading.: I enjoyed the characters in the book and also the story really kept my interest.

No Christmas would seem complete without it. But it is *because* I love this show (and otherwise would give it five stars without hesitation) that I'm forced to give a one-star review of this particular 2008 remastered/deluxe version. The reason? This new version is out of sync. In other words, the mouth movements of the characters as they speak no longer properly match the actual voices you hear on the audio track. If you already own this version, watch yours carefully; you'll see what I mean. There's a noticeable lag. If you're considering buying this DVD, you might want to wait until Warner Bros. gets its team back to the drawing board and amends this annoying error. Perhaps such a flaw won't bother some viewers; but if you're like me, it will detract from the beauty of this classic every time you watch.\", ' Great value.: This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format.

Old Englih is one of the reasons I didn't liked the book. Another reason is that is a very predictable story and it has only 2 themes: Romeo and Juliet's love and the war between their families. For me Romeo is the worst character because he only thinks about Juliet and kissing her.These and much more are the reasons of why I didn't liked the story\", \" Non-Stop Thrillride!: Run Lola Run was recommeded to me when someone found out I was a German teacher. I rented it right away and was taken on a thrill ride! This movie is fast-paced, including a great soundtrack. Lola's character overcomes a lot in just twenty minutes and you get a sense of her life as you live out three different scenarios with her. As a German teacher I would love to show this movie to my students simply to point out countless aspects of German culture. The only downside for non-German speaking viewers is having to keep up with some quick subtitles from time to time when things get really fast paced!

I liked the idea that Gillian WASN\\'T gorgeous, rich, and plain perfect, but in a snap she became the typical LJ Smith character.

Maybe if they were not so gorgeous--really how many gorgeous people are there in the world who are \"perfect\" on top of that? If you want to read LJ Smith, read the trilogies or even the other Night World books because this book reads like LJ Smith was getting desperate for a \"new\" idea.', ' Psychological thriller!: This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago.

Yes, I'm one of those paranoid new moms. This bed goes above and beyond. I wanted to buy the AeroBed first because I'm one of those people who hates to buy cheaper items because they usually break or whatever. I'm pretty much a sucker for the theory that expensive = quality. However, I went with my gut and decided to try this airbed having never heard of the company before. Listen to your gut! It inflates in 3 minutes and deflates in about 3 minutes. If you want it to be more firm & allow the air to settle in better, you should leave it in there for about 7-10min. Not a big deal at all. Go do something in another room while you're inflating it. This thing can also handle a lot of weight. When I'm sleeping on the airbed, my husband comes in the room to tell me he wants to sleep in this bed too because it's so comfy.

Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host.

I think that if we want to keep our freedom than we need to pay attention to the politicians we elect and the agencies that they are suppose to regulate.

I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society. I have read some other stories from Bradbury and part of one of his other books, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 did not match up to some of Bradbury's other works.\", \" Had to buy this for a class-- not very informative: The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information.

She is nursed back to health and is adopted by the clans medicine woman.Clan of the Cave Bear ( as well as the future books in the series )is thoroughly researched). The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts.

He is usually in control, suddenly life takes a nasty spin.Hutton takes the lead with this weak script. The plot wears thin after the first 30 minutes and then it starts to drag.

Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)\", \" co2 review: Rec'd co2 alarm 2 weeks ago.

I didnt really like this book due to the fact it was a total negative outlook throughout the whole book. His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about.', \" Simplistic Viewpoints: While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept.\", \" Barely edible: I am all for shortcuts in the kitchen and I am not a health nut or a food snob, but I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of recipes in this book that were edible. Most of them were seriously lacking in the flavor department. The fact that most of them are very poor, nutrition-wise, also concerned me a lot. She seems beholden to too many ingredients that are high in fat and sodium, as well as chemicals and preservatives. I mean, why use artificial coffee creamer in an eggnog recipe?

Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod, so wouldn\\'t it make more sense to sell the adapters individually, that way one could buy for example two European adapaters, one for ipod and one for macbook?

The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more.

But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel.

It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook.

And dont worry Sheri, he wont be writting anymore books seeing as how he has been dead for a while now. Before you criticize the writing of a wonderful author please learn how to spell correctly.1984 is a wonderful trip into the human mind and it shows how those of us in charge can and will do anything to remain in charge. It is a very good follow-up to Animal Farm. They both describe power hungry and greedy people can go to extreme measures to keep that power.Those who said the government would never end up like this are fooling yourself. The future could very easily end up like this. With the formation of the \"Homeland Security\" it is becoming even more likely that this may well be the future of the world.

I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list. I contacted Pfizer....no gluten! I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten! There are many responsible guides for celiacs.

Personally I think she's a bore....and a boor; actually I found her to be pompous. She had a wonderful idea which could have been made better. Sue Bender, you need to grow up.\", \" Very Good printer: I had a very hard time trying to find a printer that I could afford that printed good quality images. I had an Epson 440 printer that wasn't very good with printing photos and it always put streaks of black ink on everything. I went to Staples to buy a new printer after my Epson died on me and was planning on buying the Canon S600 but they were out of stock so I picked up the HP deskjet 940c and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here that I might not have a good printer but so far this printer is great! The first thing I printed on it was an old photo of my grandfather that came out better than the original. I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to be a bit slow in printing but as long as the printing comes out well that doesn't bother me too much. I would definitely recommend this printer.\", \" McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer: I like it. I live on the west side of the Cascade Range in Oregon and things get dingy pretty quick. I had my vehicle, the rain gutters on the house, landscaping bricks along the path around the house, and odds and ends all washed in about an hour. It works great. The only drawback that I can find is that it doesn't appear to suck up any cleaning solution in the high pressure mode. Only the low pressure. I haven't tried the upper tank yet so maybe that's the problem. Not a huge issue since plain water pretty much takes everything off anyway. The plastic double male hose attachment was a concern before I purchased the unit. I'd read that most of them broke pretty quick. As long as you are aware not to stress it out dragging it around, it will probably last a good long time. If it does break it should be easy to replace pretty cheap. Again great unit so far.\", \" Canon NB-5L Battery for Canon camera: I purchased a Canon camera a couple of years ago and a Canon battery came with it. I bought a couple of generic brand batteries to use as backup. After a very short time, the generic brand batteries would only keep a charge for about ten minutes or less. Having learned my lesson, I purchased this additional Canon NB-5L battery for my backup. It holds a long charge and is very reliable. Don't waste your money on generic brands like I did, buy the name brand.\", \" Not more than meets the eye: 20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys. The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it.\", \" EXCELLENT: Eddie Palmieri, like most early-1970s jazz players, must have known popular music had taken over the world and caught the bug.Whether he wanted to make money or just expand his horizons, it really doesn't matter.He formed this band, Harlem River Drive, in 1970, and made one hell of an album. Truth be told, this project does not have much to do with the Latin Jazz Eddie is known for. Harlem River Drive is an out and out soul funk album: wha whas, grooving percussion, all the ingredients you would expect from a crack unit during the era.And more: with a baritone sax--an extremely underused instrument in all genres--in front, this album has a uniquely jazzy flavor, even though the beats could be off a Santana or War or Mandrel album.As funk, it works full bore, but the novel textures here make an already fantastic funk project so much more.\", ' Rambling, boring, and confusing: Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale.', \" Barbie's Boring Ice Show: I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game.\", ' What I expected: Friend told me about the book , have not started to read it yet.

His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism\\'s merit lies in its service to the \"common good.\" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand.', \" Excellent DVD: Music for Montserrat is an exceptional DVD. Every artist, Eric Clapton, Paul Mc Cartney, Elton John, just to name a few are wonderful and the sound is amazing. A great addition to anyone's DVD collection.\", ' Somewhat outdated: This book was published in 1987 and reprinted in 1994. The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC. I do think this was an excellent book in 1987, but digital music has moved on a long way since then.', \" Blah: Another wonderful, practically edge-of-conscious novel with no definite plot by everyone's favorite perfectly insane Beat writer. In many ways I enjoy this book even better than 'On the Road.' It contains the same exciting beauty, applied to different subjects,and the same eccentric freedom fighters as lead characters. Every once in a while it attains the perfect harmony it seeks, turning long stretches with no apparent action into meditations on the beauty of nothingness, of loneliness, etc. We see the budding alcoholism of our narrator, which wil turn into a book ('Big Sur') of its own. We see what Kerouac saw in Buddhism, and we'll see converts in the book's readers. Kerouac has perhaps more real-life affect on his readers than any other American novelist, one of the few writers anywhere who really can change lives. Blah.\", \" some books suffer from abridgement: The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also.\", ' Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality: This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing.

Nothing creative, nothing interesting, and nothing original. STUPID! I found it hard not to laugh.

I read it in seventh grade and I recommend it to anyone who likes books. Fahrenheit 451 has a very captivating plot and is pretty well written, but at some parts it got extremely confusing, especially at the part when Guy Montag's wife took too much drugs or something like that.

But take this for what it is - the ONLY film document of one of the major moments in rock history - Bowie performing with the original Spiders From Mars as his gender-bending Ziggy Stardust persona. Add the fact that it is maybe the only recorded document of Mick Ronson live, and what more could you want?! (OK, I'm a guitarist, and Ronson is one of my guitar heroes, and so I guess I am biased). But really - what an incredible performance! Bowie and Ronson - it just doesn't get much better than that...\", ' Haunting...: I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important.', \" not what people think: this book is very mediocre, it has very little correct information. the practice test especially the math parts have a lot of questions that are irrelevant when taking the actual test none of the questions you have practiced for math is on the actual test. the info about the time and amount of questions in the test are correct but be warned.

Highly recommended. 5/5.', ' Sheets OK - package/label looks really cheap.: The sheets seem fine but the packaging looks like something you would see at \"Dollar General\". They come off looking very cheap - not a big deal at all really unless you are giving them as a gift.', \" Great read: This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth\", ' Don\\'t Trust the Images: Dockers are Dockers, so that\\'s not the problem. Just be sure you don\\'t trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. \"Cafe,\" for example, should be \"Coffee.\" Despite the fact that the image for \"Cafe\" shows a stone or very light gray color, \"Cafe\" is actually dark brown. So the product isn\\'t defective, but IS misleading: I didn\\'t want brown pants, but that\\'s what I got.', \" okay for the price: I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine.

He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by.', \" strangely wonderful: If you've seen that strange and wonderful movie, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. If the triplet's song plays over and over in your head, then you need the cd, because not only is it there three times (twice in French and once in English), but the French Mafia' s theme shows you those horrid clones perfectly.

I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they\\'re poorly covered by \"the Starlite Singers\".', \" Oh god kill me now, this book is BAD.: This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS.\", ' Castle in the attic: This book was dull non for feeling non inspiring boring made no sense. I would not recomended this book to a friend it is terrible. I rather read something else rather than this book', \" A surprisingly effective fantasy for beginning readers: If you want to introduce the fantasy genre to a younger reader, I can't imagine a better starting place than this book. A lot of story is packed into this beginning chapter book. Although some profound issues are raised, I think what will appeal to most young readers is the adventure and the relationship between the boy and the new pet he brings home - which, in this case, happens to be a dragon! Readers will no doubt want to read the rest of the books in this series which, though not as good, are certainly entertaining.\", \" Distrubing Portent of Socialism's Logical Ends: This is the classic and the mould of the dystopian narrative. Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end.\", ' How could you give it less than five stars?: When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was \"Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest.\" Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn\\'t even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world.', \" Amazingly Good: I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected.\", ' What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce and Custody:: This book was a god send. It helped me with so many issues. I found it to be a true survival guide with advice that works. I purchased the book months ago when I was first separated. Now my ordeal is almost over but I still keep the book by my nightstand and refer to it constantly.', \" Not what I expected: This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there.\", \" Reflections from Largely Ignored Golfing Foundation: Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro's students who do good. These pros (male and female now) are true backbone of the sport, feeding the sport. In this case, Claude Harmon Jr. reflects on his father, famous club pro and player who wore the coveted Green Jacket.One clearly learns of life lessons Butch carried to his life and students from his father. Salient to his father's remarkable and here documented career is association with Henry Ford and Ben Hogan.There are many gleanings to take from this for golf, for life. Worth read which is personal and honest and passionate, reflecting the author.\", ' Not good for showers: Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows.', \" Couldn't wait for it to be over!: I don't understand how anyone can like this trash. It was long, plotless (besides the whole wife commiting suicide thing-I would've too if I were married to Paul), random and most of the time I was asking myself 'what the f---?'I can understand that it was shocking for the time, especially that butter scene but otherwise, it was a huge waste of time. Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman. They had absolutely NO chemistry and most of the time, I had no idea what they were going on about. Overrated, overrated, overrated.2+ hours of your life you'll never get back.\", ' The only boots my husband will wear: These boots are very well made. my husband wears them for work and he loves them. They hold up well even with every day wear, got a year+ out of the last pair. he also says they are very comfortable.', ' Awesome for those who love the beach and sand!: It creates a calming atmosphere yet allows you to dream of the beach,the sand is a tad dusty though.', \" a major classic: i felt i had to put my two cents in. I read this book several years ago and still remember the magical way the story unfolded. Do Not Miss Out. You will long remember a place and people who existed in Gabe's wonderful imagination. The book is a rare gift of words.\", \" Fantastic glider/ bench: Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio.\", \" Fun, but fragile: My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. He and his 3yo brother played with it non-stop! It was a huge hit. But now here we are just a week later and the crocodile won't keep his mouth open :( The kids still play with it, but of course not nearly as much. They just hold his mouth open and push all the teeth down, then ignore it for the most part. Part of me wants to buy another, but I'm worried about it just breaking again.\", ' WHY???????????????????????????????????????????????????: WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text? It is enough to put anyone off English Lit for LIFE. If anyone in authority is reading this, PLEASE take this piece of junk OFF the sylabus...PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!', \" An interesting little essay: Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile.\", ' Noise Pollution: Every time I hear that song \"One Wish\" it makes me want to throw up. I hope he never makes another CD.', \" LOVE the stories, HATE that the publisher destroyed the artwork: As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. I was quite upset, upon buying this for my son, to find that the publisher had commissioned new artwork. I'm sure they thought it would make it accessible to a younger audience, and if you're an overprotective helicopter parent who doesn't want your kid to be scared, maybe they're right...but then why buy the book in the first place?I have nothing against Mr. Helquist - he's a very talented artist. But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book. It's equivalent to The Velveteen Rabbit or Peter Rabbit with new illustrations...an abomination, and NOT of the good, scary kind!\", \" Can't believe I read the whole thing: Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did.\", ' Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.: I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets.', \" Boring, very: This book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end. I really disliked the book.\", \" Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!!: A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.\", ' Fun Lola Fun: The plot is simple: Lola\\'s boyfriend Manny gets dropped in the grease when he loses a fortune that belongs to a gang of thugs. Of course, they want to kill him. Of course, he knows his cool and devoted girlfriend, Lola, will figure out a way to get ahold of the money. And of course, she realistically doesn\\'t have enough time to do it.What to do? Get the cash from Rich Banker Daddy? Steal the money? Win it?This is a Euro-slick film, shot like a music video. It asks, \"So she failed that time...but what if she tried it ANOTHER way?\" The audience follows Lola as she chases down the money...she does it again and again.Even though Manny is no choirboy, and Lola is not exactly Mother Teresa, you cheer for her and urge her on as the action speeds up. I liked Lola because she faces the problem head-on and then does what she\\'s gotta do. The movie is a pleasure to watch, with none of the heavy-handed angst European films so often get slammed for.', \" DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: My son is a HUGE bat man fan. This was a must last christmas.. well we never could get it to stand up right and then bat man wouldnt slide down with out him pushing him the rest of the way. It came apart no matter how easy he was with it. And he lost interest less than a week of tring to make it work. He still wants a bat cave so we bought the older version (that has great reviews)instead this christmas so hopefully this one will be the one to make him happy and my pocket book.\", ' A truly poignant, touching film: This is a fabulous movie adapted from a wonderful book. Both are worth purchasing. The novel is called \"Father of Frankenstein,\" by Christopher Bram. I read (and loved) the book before seeing the movie, and initially, I was hesitant to see the film version at all. So many film adaptations of great books excise the heart and soul of the original. But I was convinced to see the movie and was very pleasantly surprised. It is subtle, touching, and poignant. To sum it up: this movie is simply well written, well directed, well made, and especially well acted. Do yourself a favor and see this movie -- it is truly touching. But first, read the book. Both will impress you.', ' Voltaire - Genius of Mockery: Voltaire Genius of Mockery book is about the life of Voltaire, French philosopher, poet and novelist. It covers his entire life from birth to death. Each page comes alive and one can picture his joys and his frustrations as he battles the repressive Catholic Church and the French monarchy over the publication of his books, his plays and his personal philosophy. Also, his fight for the rights of the persecuted is eloquently portrayed in the period just before the French Revolution. One also gets a glimpse of the life in the 18th century through his relationships with Fredrick the Great, King of Prussia, Madame du Chatelet his lover, and Louis XV, King of France. One will understand his stories, such as Candid when one knows the man and his smile.', \" Burn This Book! - OK No, Just Kidding: If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet.\", \" Far Cry From Original: Don't waste your time or money on this remake. Even Rebecca's hotness can't save it. Watch the original with James Caan.\", \" Excellent!: Some of the reviews I've heard and read here and elsewhere contain criticism of Mr Selengut's journalistic style, grammar, spelling and even the relatively amateur way the book appears to have been typeset. SO WHAT?! If you are prepared to follow his easy-to-follow advice; to pay attention to the detail and to do your own individual stock research, it's worthwhile. I read the book twice and highlighted the most important points the second time around. In three and a half months, I have realized profits of $44,176 and unrealized net gains of $7,509.

Item was in very good condition.', ' the real horror in this horror movie: When I first saw the preveiw for this movie it looked intriguingly scary. But that all changed when I actually saw it. I found it to be very boring. I was actully waiting to get scared. The preveiw for this movie was scarier.Also, the storyline was exceptionally weak and nearly drowned out by way too many special effects.this movie was just another \"tech show\".', \" Terrible: This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart.\", ' SO Expensive BUT...: Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet.', \" too much gyrating and not enought interest for me: Now, this is my mind on this movie. Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same.

King indeed; he's pretty good but the King has been dead awhile (notwithstanding the occasional phantom sighting) and the remaining living creators of original rock and roll - Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry are very much alive and touring and in Jerry Lee's case still recording great music.I'll take a look at buying this if I can see and hear what it is!Jimp.s. sorry for the 1 star but ...\", ' Alarmingly realistic: Bradbury is a master of the genre. In \"Fahrenheit 451\", he once again shows his literary genius. Proving points such as \"knowledge is thy strength, fear is not thine strength\". He shows the importance of the written word and the dangers of censorship. This book made me think, which is contrary to this book. It made me think about how much we take for granted, even if it is just thinking. As they say, an oldie, but goodie. Not to be missed', ' 2 Unlimited is back, but not as you\\'d expect them to.: They\\'re back, not as Anita & Ray but as Romy and Marion. The song \"Wanna Get Up\" in (my) opinion is not as good as other tracks released by the band, since there\\'s no techno-rapping by Ray, and not as good vocals & lyrics. On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On \"Wanna Get Up\" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the \"SASH! Extended Edit\" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version. The other two remixes are extrermely poor and do not relate with the type of music 2 Unlimited sings.', ' Take the time and go to the casses: This DVD was over rated and to be honest, as a first time mother, I found watching this video in my 6 & 7 month to be nerve racking and at times scary.

The classes were informative, I received more info there along with some freebeees.', ' Yuck!: I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy.

This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in.\", \" Will not work with PrintServers: I bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time I could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network ready printer.

In the first hour or so there is hardly any dialogue... just a nude scene after another. The only main dailogue is \"Take off your cloth.\" And personally I don\\'t consider this as a dialogue either.I didn\\'t see the love story in this movie... no honest expressions. Just a man who lives a play boy life.

Maybe if there was a better (senseful) ending..!', \" Wow, What a Disappointment: It's really difficult to make a good movie with bad material. But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this.\", \" RB did a great job describing why censorship is wrong: Bradbury's way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship. It seems ridiculous that the could actually become that crazy, but if we tried to make the world perfect-it would leave many people unhappy. And if we destroy books, we're destroying a person's valuable opinion containing the key to the past.\", ' Soot-covered Sentimentality: Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola\\'s sweeping \"Germinal\". For the best critique of Dickens, read \"Against Nature\" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade.', ' Unreliable: Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date.

And they feel great - like I'm walking on cushions.The only downside so far is the leather has worn more quickly than I expected and the waterproofing seems to be wearing off - even after an additional waterproofing treatment.Update:My left boot stopped being supportive after about 90 miles of mid-weight backpacking (with 30-40 lbs).

I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the \"in-laws\" of Rani\\'s character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan\\'s character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live \"Happily Ever After\". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage.', \" Disappointed with the sound quality: If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one.

It is a part of flea control and should not be expected to be the one answer for every flea. Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control.\", \" A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches: This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game.

This book was a pretty strong expression of Pratchett's religious stance, in my opinion. The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book.

Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing.

Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly \"Push It\" and \"Special\", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: \"Temptation Waits\", \"When I Grow Up\", \"Medication\", and \"You Look So Fine.\"Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them.', ' He likes it!: I bought this as a gift for my husband and the more he uses it, the more he is thrilled with it.

I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover.

We saw the same tree at a well known hardware store for double the price. The tree is easy to assemble and even comes with a DVD that explains how to put tree together. The tree comes adorned with pinecones and snow frosted tips. It looks just like the trees we cut near Placerville, CA. It is our first artificial tree and we love it!', \" The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE!: I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Apart from the Dirty Dozen blu-ray, this is the worst I have seen. I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray.\", ' Spend your money better: This book is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ.

It was fun to read.', \" Great Ep: this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out.

It\\'s lyrics, sound, and beat make it a much better choice than Oops! I did it again! or Christina Agulara! This CD is suitable for all ages!

Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary.

I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $\", \" Short Product Life: This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer.\", \" I'm afraid it sucks.: I saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame, but I'm afraid it's all true. My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy, within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230. I don't care what the explanation is, frankly-- card error is a scary thing to see. Magically, replacing my trusty (if allegedly slower) SanDisk cards rectifies all problems. I swear, I did nothing wrong-- it's idiot proof. This card is just wacky.\", \" Really great 'baby book' for your 4-legged children: This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves their dogs as children. I bought one for our 3 year old adopted beagle, and am getting one for our daugher-in-law's birthday for their rottie. You can personalize it as you wish, and I have included comic clippings (Marmaduke, Mutts, etc.) that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever.\", ' Bad product. Horrible drivers: I purchased this product to upgrade my old all-in-wonder card. I love ATI for their wonderfully multi-functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them. I tried to install this card on Windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions (after reading another review here) for each driver. The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software. Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card. I might try the Radeon 7500 in the near future (since I suspect that the \"DV\" output of the card had something to do with my problems).', ' Wonderful book, except for the part with all the words.: The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it\\'s actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from \"Foundation\" to \"How Not to Write a Book\" or \"Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English.\" I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight.', ' Boring, don\\'t waste your time: This movie is so boring. I was looking forward to it. But they bash America and the flying scenes look fake.Long boring love story that ends with both characters not finding each other.Rent or buy \"The Blue Max\" it\\'s much better.', ' good story, overdetailed writing: Having first viewed the TV version of this story, I find that the written version tends to be overlong and overdetailed.

WORST MOVIE EVER.. try Halloween orExorcist if you want a REAL horror movie.', ' Some great movies: Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these movies. Thought maybe they would be sub pr because there were so many for such a great price. Actually some real gems and some great actors.', ' Worth it for the Furs cover alone.: Okay, a lot of this has been released elsewhere and some might find the price tag unjustified. However, this is worth it if for no other reason than the weird postmodern refraction (or something like that) of Robyn covering fellow \\'80s college rock casualties of the great alternative sellout of the 1990s, The Psychedelic Furs. \"The Ghost in You\" gains something in his sparse folk arrangement that it didn\\'t have in its synth heavy/Richard Butler\\'s limited vocal range but still great original version.Get it before it goes out of print like every other Hitchcock release.Signed,epsteinsmutha', \" Barely red enough: Sold as red, obviously.But I find them to be more pink than dark red.

A truely great movie for all ages.', ' ~ Erotic Fantasy ~: This is a lovely erotic fantasy. There are glimpses of BDSM but it is not \"hardcore\".Do not compare this book to the movie of the same name ~ The movie version is camped up & changed to make the story light & funny ~ The actual story in this book is not light and not funny, it is more of a complicated romance, between two people who don\\'t realize how much they need each other.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hopefully, you will too ~ and if you do, you may seriously want to pick up the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy.', \" Buy the original.: I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed.\", ' A Classic Theme In Life: I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time.', \" The autobiography of my mother: It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star.\", \" Hypatia: A classic story based on history. One of Hypatia's crimes appears to have been ready to provide a hypothesis of a heliocentric universe, long before Copernicus and with a much worse response from the Christian community.\", \" Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase: The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars.\", \" A nice companion to McQuarrie's text: I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book. McQuarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter. One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book.\", \" Uninspired: Gee, I wasn't as impressed as you guys. I found it quite tedious. Bram Stoker's original is one of a kind. This is not even remotely in the same league. Sorry.\", \" Ho-Hum: One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. My main complaint is when I see a theatrical trailer for a movie, and that rrailer implies the movie is a comedy, and then the movie does not deliver what the trailer seems to have promised, I hit the ceiling.There are characters in this movie who's inclusion makes no sense since they don't advance the plot and don't really come off as amusing either.The whole premise of buying a house in a foreign country in which you barely speak the language makes no sense either.I don't know -- maybe it's me -- it seems like the time would have been better spent watching a travel film on Tuscany.Ho-HUM!!\", ' Poor quality on Kindle: I purchased the e-version of this book to be read on my Kindle. There were numerous spelling errors where two words had been combined into one. The further intothe book theworse it got. Two to three errorsper page. I believe a spell checkwould have pickedthese allup.', \" Cleverly imaginative yet unbearingly boring: As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on.\", ' Even Mommy has fun with this one!: My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!', ' A Scholarly Book for Serious Students of Yiddish: Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich\\'s \"College Yiddish\" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn\\'t \"dry as dust,\" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended.', \" Excellent Book; Terrible Kindle Version: The one-star review is solely due to the problems accurately reported by other readers. There are critical passages early in the book (articles from newspapers) that are entirely missing from the Kindle version.The book itself is one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories.

I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past.\", \" Very informative!: My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting.\", ' Faulty Product - Horrible Support: I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization.', ' Know what is happening inside you: Pregnancy can be a very long wait.

Will I alter other peoples' lifes by bumping into them? - You have never asked yourself those questions? Well, you certainly will after seeing this movie.

And now Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 German Marks. The phone hits the floor and Lola starts running... Americans, who are usually not very fond of foreign movies, should not let the 'dubbed' stop them. Dare to watch it and a race is waiting for you. Tom Tykwer created a 90 minute video clip.

It has always been one of my favorites. I cannot tell you how many times I have read Lorna Doone but I love it more each time.', ' Great Movie: Purchased this dvd as a gift.

Described by Shirley Manson herself as \"mongrel-esque,\" the band\\'s style is a unique compendium of diverse musical genres. The result is a tight, masterfully-crafted audio experience. Pure listening enjoyment.', \" ok: it was good. one of the dvd's glitched after a while of playing. the screen froze and wouldn't play. the dvd's were dirty. i cleaned them up and seemed to work fine. so overall it was ok.\", \" Looking forward to reading other books by this author: This book was so fascinating that I could not take a break from reading it. I look forward to reading Dr. Han's books The Secret Life of Quanta and The Probably Universe.\", ' Good Movie: I love the full screen edition of the movie. I do not like the movies that is half screen. I like this movie because it reminds me that there is life after divorce or any other life altering event. But we have to move forward to achieve it.', ' \"Special\" CD: This is a wonderful CD, Shirley Manson has a great voice, and the lyrics make you want to get up and dance. I was hooked the first time I heard them, the songs are great.', \" Easy read for brain information: This book was purchased for a PhD level course. It is a very easy read. It gives practical applications to the latest brain research. On a down note, there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study, but he does give an extensive bibliography. This book can be used for parents to read about how their child's brain works, or for teachers within a school system. It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint.\", \" RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris: Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story.

Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that.\", ' Pretty Awesome!!: This book, was in my opinion, pretty good. Not one of her best, but it was good. I really liked the story, and I really liked the characters. To me, the story had a different meaning, than most people had seen. If you read between the lines, you see that this is what a lot of people hope for. To be popular, to be perfect in every aspect, and to have power. I really liked this book, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Lisa Jane Smith, or anyone who likes books about \"Creatures Of The Night\" :)', ' Excellent sound: The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. Its not as attractive and a little larger, but the features are well placed and the remote is very useful.Mine got damaged by a bad surge, so if you get one, use a surge protector with it to preserve it.', \" STOP. We waited 8 months for THIS ?: I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great.

Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money.

When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined. There really is not much to say about this movie. The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of \"Predators\". It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like \"Predators\". If you are a HUGE Predator or Sci-fi fan you would probebly like this, otherwise go ahead and aviod this and anyone who wants you to watch it. I give it a D.Would I watch again? - No way!

Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING!

This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of \"show, don\\'t tell\"? This book only TELLS why books are important.

His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful.

He helps to remind us that books and knowledge are what we crave and need to be happy.\", \" Beautiful and touching: I must say that this was one of the most touching, tragic and beautiful film/book I've ever seen/read. I love this story so much because it is so absolutely realistic and that it is human nature to do what a lot of the characters in the film did. There were so many human flaws, which I love it so much. It wasn't one of those movies where one character was absolutely perfect while the other one was downright horrible, but the flaws were evenly placed like real humans. We all have flaws, only different. We're all different.Once again, I love the film, although I loved the book so much more. It was so much more touching than the film had been, although the movie was great! The letters in the book were a lot more touching in the movie, maybe because I can actually see the spelling mistakes Ugolin and Papet makes. I wonder if they have spelling mistakes in the letters on the English version of the book?

The stones could also be better, but the design is so catching that it makes up for it. I should also add that Charoite is a very hard stone to find at a good price, so if you are looking at affordable, this is it. Trust me, I spent several hours searching. Overall I really like this pendant.', ' a great action movie: Transformers: dark of the moon arguably has the best action compare with its predecessors.

If you like books that flow but have a deeper teaching then you should buy this book. Let this book be a deeper devotional or a study tool for your next teaching on a parable.

When I heard the opening theme, I was in sci-fi heaven. I love Stargate SG1 and was sad to see it go.

I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?A.

I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy.\", \" Misleading: If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences.

Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike.

If you name a book, \"Nappily Ever After\" you\\'re gonna trick hair conscious women (which is practically every woman) into reading your novel. But is it really about hair?The basis is about hair but the message the author is trying to convey is about finding who you are and being comfortable with that. The author is a very good writer and storyteller. She took a very basic idea and made it into a very entertaining story with a lesson. A lot of people can\\'t do that very well. It\\'s just a simple lesson that most women can relate too. Nothing deep or philosophical (we have Octavia Butler for that) but a lesson about being comfortable with who you are.I give it 4 stars: It\\'s a nice story.... good airplane read, poolside read, whatever.

He does so well, you forget after awhile that he doesn\\'t look Japanese.This film, which came out in the very early 60\\'s I think, is based on a play by Leonard Spiegelgass. Some of the dialog by the daughter and son-in-law comes across as dated and stilted, but the performances by Guinness and Russell eclipse everything else, bringing to life a lovely story that reminds us that youth, despite its \"modernity,\" isn\\'t wiser or smarter than experience and minds that are willing to change and grow.I\\'m so glad this film has finally been put on DVD.', \" The best keeps on getting better and better.: Dylan? Jagger and Richards? Lennon and McCarthy? For my money the best songwriter ever is Guy Clark. His latest effort does not dissapoint. It is a social injustice that Guy Clark isn't a megastar.

There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic!

It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens.

It took the premise of adapting Homer\\'s literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great \"in\" jokes.

When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book.

In a darkened atmosphere like the Sci-Fi Restaurant, these cubes show up great.I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests.

This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they \"don\\'t get it\" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn\\'t get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it.', \" weak advice: The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made.\", \" Too bad Amazon can't help out students: I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you.\", \" Meh.: Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys.\", \" 1962 version bothered me: I have several fetal development books now, but this one is the only one I couldn't stand to keep. I tore out a few of the best pictures and threw the rest of the book away. I had the 1962 version, so I can't speak for any other editions. It explains in the book that the picture sequences documenting the development of movement were of babies born very early, as early as the 6th week. I don't believe they were aborted on purpose or anything, but I couldn't stand to see how they were being touched with a hair to see how they move... that seems cruel to me. That sort of thing is not what I want to see when I'm expecting! The authors other book, Beginning Life is much, much better.

I never regret purchasing this lcd monitor though my 17 inch CRT which this replaced was truly sharp. This lcd is totally comparable in sharpness which is a plus when editing your digital pictures. It being flat makes you take back very much needed space, of course. If you only have analog connector on your pc you will still find this lcd okay. I installed a pc card with digital connector on my pc thus allowing its signal to stay digital (versus the pc converting its signal to analog so you could use your crt monitor which is of course analog).

I, personally, don't care for any type of science fiction, so that could play a part in my rating, but it was very confusing and not worth my time. The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused. The book ends in a chase which was by far the best part. If you don't enjoy science fiction, I do not recommend this book for you. I only read it because it was required of me.\", ' Good Boots: Comfotable fit on the loose side. I use a heavier sock and works just fine. Recommended and would buy again.', \" One Hundred Years of Solitude: An amazingly beautiful lyrical book which carefully weaves magicical realism into the intricate account of 100 years of a family, each character unique, complex and endearing. Every sentence reads like poetry and soon you are entranced, finding yourself drifting dazily into the town of Macondo, and imagining hanging your cot with the rest of the Buendia family. I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love. Only the brilliance of Marquez could combine all of this into one book. And most delightful of all, the images linger long after the last page has been read.\", \" It's a shame there are not 0 stars on ratings: Reasons not to buy this video:1.

If you haven't played the first one then your out of luck because it's sold out(lucky me, I have a copy ^_^)The story may be confusing if you missed out on the first GH because the people who are being assimilated into the main character are actually from the first game!

True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film.\", ' Take the good with the bad: Ok, before I bought this DVD, I read all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. IT WAS!

It was too late for us to get into a class, and this was really so informative, and it went over pretty much everything you need to know about going thru labor or having a c-section. So, for the people who said it wasnt enough cuz you didnt get to interact with couples or instructor, why did you buy it? Its great if you cant go to a class. What you learn is the most important part of this, isnt it?', \" Not entirely a comedy: I am big fan of Judd Apatow's work. i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies, that it has a more somber, serious tone. so my expectations were tempered. I liked it, i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long, which is why I take off one star. But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virgin/knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in.\", ' Zero Resolution: I\\'m sure I am one of a select few that do not appreciate a story that develops great characters and great sub-plots and then ends abruptly.

While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille. Eventually all of the sexual overtones became annoying and unrealistic. Perhaps the author would have had better success as a \"Young Adult\" writter, because, despite the sex, that is how this book came across.', \" The Naturalist's Guide: This book is literally a Naturalist's guide. I can't believe there are not more 5 star ratings of this book. As an arborist, birder, and wildlife biologist born in the piedmont I recommend this book.\", \" Good basic story, but many flaws: I found the basic idea of the book to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral. It almost becomes a completely different story.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the author's practice on going back and the forth between past and present was confusing.\", \" Wouldn't recommended: This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months, and the 'CF Card Error' started happending (as some of the other reviewers have also experienced).

I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon. A good read.\", ' Simple: If you are patient enough to finish it, you will like it: But if you give up before, it will not make sense to you and excuses will start to appear.

Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here. Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues. And, of course, how you think is the basis for what you think. Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect.

The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me. For those unfamiliar with Jungian psychology, this book serves as a useful introduction.', ' Excellent book for those who own companion lovebirds: A visit to my local library yielded many books about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet.

I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products.\", ' Impractical: The previous reviews must have come from students of theauthor\\'s, or students of students of the author\\'s. Perhaps friends ofthe author? I can\\'t imagine anyone thinking this book is good. A good comedy, maybe.The techniques in this Ju-Jitsu book are almost offensive in terms of practicality. And though he does outline some tactics and concepts for applying the techniques of this art, this is most likely a book for his students to read so they can brush up for their tests, but not for serious self-defense.In fact, this is not a book for any one interested in learning self-defense. Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it, unless you\\'re a student of the author, of course.

Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don\\'t generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. \"Seduce Me\" is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner\\'s sexual desire.', ' hard topic but well worth the knowledge: Ms Too has tackled a subject that is immensely difficult to learn.

I just became more and more orange, it streaked everywhere, and overall looked extremely fake.

It makes you laugh so much...\", ' Early Hopkins story still sends chills through viewers: \"Magic\" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The dummy is not exactly a Charlie McCarthy and there are parts not for the squeamish. Ann Margret has a curious role in this tale, but she does it well. Along with \"The Bunker\" and his over-the-top Quasimodo in the \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\", the viewer gets an excellent foretaste of what was to come in his Hannibal Lecter roles.', \" Need a dictionary!: The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!\", \" Does not work: According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices.\", \" Sfar's Best!: A delightfully funny story! A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat's-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. It's a love story. Very funny and endearing. And the hero is a cat! This is a must for Joann Sfar fans.\", ' Thinking Book (Review written by Muad\\'Dib): This is a really wierd book. In the beginning it starts out like any country in a war, but later it delves deeper. The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein\\'s book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show \"Big Brother\"), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future. If you like Orwell\\'s books you\\'ll LOVE Animal Farm.', ' Not as good as the first, but excellent!: The book CARIBES is the second in a series of six books by Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa. The first book being, CIENFUEGOS I, which was an exceptional book that I couldn\\'t put down once I began reading it. The tradition follows with CARIBES, although not as exciting as the first book, this book continues to entertain and makes you laugh, as well as giving you factual knowledge about the discovery of the \"new world.\" Highly recommended. I just wish that Amazon had all six books (cienfuegos, caribes, montenegro, azabeche, xaragua - and one more that I can\\'t remember off hand).', ' The unbearable lightness of being: This is already my favorite movie for at least ten years, from the first time I saw it. It is a movie about an unsettled men who lives life lightly, but is also in love. Slowly he is adapting to a life with only one woman, the one he loves. The very romantic and chalenging movie is set in Chechie around 1965 somewhere.', ' False Advertising: The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has \"alternate views\" showing these items. And the kicker is that its 10$ more than the other colors, so it seems like its a package deal, but I only got the one purple vibe. I totally would have gotten the clear one for less money if I knew that was the case because who cares what color it is really. I, for one, am about function over fashion. FALSE ADVERTISING!!', \" Not sure about veracity of the material: The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society.\", ' ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance: I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully.

Therefore, the title is misleading. It should read \"Manson, in Emmons\\' words\". More of the same rhetoric espoused by Bugliosi and the establishment.For a better, fresher look at Manson- check out \"Charles Manson Superstar\" on VHS.', \" love it: great movie!!! cage is a great druggie i mean for being a cop. what a way to gain trust from the bad folk's.\", \" Gripping: This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy.\", ' WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE AGAIN!: This book arrived 2 months after I ordered it. I had already went to my trip to Greece. I was so pissed off!', ' leave your seat and hop a plane!!!: I saw this movie at a sneak preview and will see it again when it comes out just because I know a few people who need to see this movie. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on thier luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place. I laughed, I cried several times this movie evoked that youthful part inside me that needs to be awakened every so often. With the beautiful cinematography and portrayal of the people you want to leave your seat and hop a plane for Tuscany. I heard so many people saying that as they left the theatre. Go see this movie and laugh and cry all at the same time.', ' Good choice for light duty homeowners: I bought this since the big MK I also use was too heavy and messy to take into condos. I rehab ocean condos and lug all my tools into the condo for 2-3 months (compressor, table saw, router table, etc). So I focus on portability first.However, the instructions were limited, the arbor allows the blade to not spin true, and the setup screws will be quickly lost after unpacking.But strangely - the saw and fence quickly cut straight after you allow for the width of the blade wobble. Angles require some extra work. I used a 7\" speed square against the fence for diagonal cuts. I haven\\'t tried the 1.3\" cutting depth yet. It should do it. But for how long? I don\\'t see it as a long term contractor grade saw but as a saw that can be used for 2-3 yrs with about 2-3 jobs per year.', \" Not worth the effort: Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment.\", \" Usher's Concert: If you a fan of Usher this blue ray concert is a must have. The quality and his performances are very good.\", ' Definately worth knowing: I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read \"Diary of a Madman\", \"The Nose\", and \"The Overcoat\". The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today.', ' Horrible.: I have had the first DVD since I bought my first dance hoop over a year ago, and figured that I would give the second one a try. This DVD is horrible! The picture and sound quality sucks. The picture is grainy and the sound is off. I could have made a better DVD in my backyard with my small camera. It is over-priced and they could have fit so much more in one DVD. I am so dissapointed that Hoopnotica would put out such a low quality product.', ' Difficult product: I bought this DVD for the Mozart Symphony #35. However, it is very difficult to access the work. I finally figured out that the only way to do it is to fast forward through the final movement of the Lebrun Concerto. This problem was in evidence on several different DVD players one of which can track DVDs with any region code. There are some wonderful performances on this series. Too bad the engineering is so poor.', ' A Must-Read for Fine Arts Educators!: Jenson has updated much information in this quickly-read book. Anyone unfamiliar with his works will find this helpful; veterans of the topic will find new, useful \"ammunition.\" Especially refreshing is the unbiased approach to the Mozart effect studies; a convincing view to show administrators because of its balanced presentation.', \" one hit wonder: I tried this product. It broke during my first use. Then I contacted the seller and they told me to give good feedback and said they'd send a new one. It's been a month and I haven't received anything. I'm over this company, Joy Hollywood. Clearly they do not know how to treat customers or sell working products. the product not only broke but it, like other consumers said, smelled like something awful. I would feel safer going to an actual store where they actually test the products to make sure they work. or where they will gladly return something that was a LEMON.\", ' very poor quality: This item is on sale, for a reason. It is not any better than the original one that came with the speaker. Very thin wires. Very dissapointing. I had to go to best buy and spend $35 to get some better wires.', \" Out of date, but good: _Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe's attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries. Their stories are of course somewhat dated now, but they still capture the thrill and charm of scientific discovery. PAsteur and Robert Koch are among those profiled. Appropriate for children.\", \" Fahrenheit 451, a review of: Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual book about an alternate future. In this book, firemen have to start fires instead of putting them out. But they don't just randomly burn down peoples houses. They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age.\", \" I'm haunted by the memory of seeing this sorry movie: This movie, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Shirley Jackson's novel, quite possibly the finest haunted house story ever written, is tossed aside in favor of easy to communicate cliches and stock shocks (I guessed the BIG SURPRISE TWIST ENDING about three minutes into it and was waiting for all the other stupid characters to catch on). The worst movie of 1999 belongs in the same company as Golden Turkey winners Orca, the Killer Whale, The Swarm, and Exorcist 2: The Heretic.\", ' Victorian???Hardly!: To call this a collection of Victorian erotica is inaccurate as this implies that all the stories are from that era. I felt rather cheated to realise that a few were obviously twentieth century additions.

You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow.', ' joshua and the children: This was a wonderful and inspiring story. Words truly can strengthen our spirit.

Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually.\", \" Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA: The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money. Thanks to the deceiving reviews, I now need to spend more money to get a real beginner JAVA book.\", ' Neat book for starters into continuous-time finance: Very intuitive in explaining the basic concepts and the fundamental and widely used methods in continuous-time finance.

This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help.\", \" IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP.: You probably read towards the bottom of the description that it works with XP, and you'll even read it on the BACK OF THE PACKAGE, but it's not true. compaq still has no drivers for XP to recognize the PA-2, so if you have XP you'd better get a different mp3 player.\", ' A great book~: This book has great myths.

In light of Marlon Brando\\'s semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works. Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where\\'s the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered \"art\" and \"decent\".

It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate.

It is a story of self-examination and confusion that must be exposed for the protagonist to survive a life unrealized.

My daughter is 2 and loves Elmo's World (we have several other videos) so I figured this would be okay. WRONG! She is now having nightmares and will not be left alone in the dark because she is afraid of fire. She even shakes with fear the way Elmo does at one point during the film. I think the subject matter is too advanced for her and better suited for older children.\", \" Love this record book: It is simple enough that I don't feel like I'm scrapbooking (because who has time with a toddler and a newborn) but has a lot of fill in the blanks and page suggestions that keep me on track.

The size is right and the price is reasonable (a little cheaper would be nice, but its acceptable). The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support... or support for a number of other platforms as well. It's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems. Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot.

That may defeat the purpose of the cookbook, BUT, the recipes are what stand out, and any can me made with fresh or pre-packaged items.They are good, everyday family meals.

As soon as the car started moving the signal started coming and going and video quality, well, it looked great before the car started moving.Still, looks like a good system, just not if you plan to be moving it around.', ' Wow!: All and all this is a very nice product. It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing. It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours. The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture,although not totally, away from your skin. Now mind you it is pure rubber, yes I said rubber, so make sure you wash it thoroughly, also it will take two days to air dry.I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon......much cheaper than a boutique.Cher!', \" In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing. It's a nice addition to the horror genre and dances circles around it's U.S. counterpart.\", \" George Elliot's Romola: In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending.\", ' Very good reading.: I loved all three books. I had read the Shelters of Stone first as it was a gift, but thoroughly enjoyed going back to see where it all began. Amazing author.', ' Great easy toy: My twins love this toy. They can use it on their own and it only makes small noises. The only down side is one seems to get his finger in the way when he pushes the tops down. I love the quality of tolo toys.', \" Brilliant: I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way.\", \" high quality: I'll keep this short, since you don't need much explaination. This album slams harder than just about any other. You'll listen to it all the way through at max volume. It will absolutly blow your mind.

I wear this necklace often and love it!', ' An Acquaintance with darkness: A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Her Mother is sick with a cough that can kill her. Her Father died in the Civil war. She misses her Father so much because they were so close. The book only starts like this but it is a really good book. I like the book because I has sapience and horror, like the part when Abraham Lincoln dies and they blame it on... So it is one of the greatest books and you should read it.', \" McCartney Lovers Only: I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead.\", ' A great study of the human psyche: Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along.', \" I really tried to like it: My Mom and sister both recommended this book, but I couldn't make it through more than half. Really not very interesting. For whatever reason, women seem to find this book interesting. I have other male friends that have had the same experience. For me, nothing that grabbed my attention happened and the writing wasn't enough to make up for it.\", ' A good, traditional western: This is not one of those great five star Boetticher films (Comanche Station etc.), but still a very good one (4,5!). Scott is always good. He is so natural that one does not give enough credit for his acting. There are a lot good actors in this film though my favorite Virginia Mayo does not have very much to do. The only minus is the somewhat predictable story. Burt Kennedy did not write this one. I recommend this film highly. The dvd quality is also great.', \" This book is boring!: This book doesn't deserve a maximum of 1,000 words! It is pointless and inconsistent. Don't read it! How could our society ever become one not dependent on books for knowledge and wisdom?\", \" Clan of the Cave Bear: I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I found it fascinating. I have read it again from cover to cover at least twice since then. It is very well researched, and I couldn't put it down. I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series. Hurry Ms. Auel, there are a lot of us waiting to hear what happened to Ayla.\", ' Heart Becomes a Hair Band: To me this was the beginning of the end for the Wilson sisters. Sure, there are some okay songs on here, or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can\\'t believe I used to like them. To put it mildly, this album was Heart\\'s contribution to the 1980s \"hair band\" movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard\\'s guitar playing.

A great way to turn back the clock and experience a simpler time, if only for 20 minutes.', ' Terry Pratchett is a great author!: This is another book in the Discworld series, and the second book in the Sam Vimes/Watch story-line. It introduces a couple of characters that become regulars. Well-written and a joy to read.', \" Regret to buy this book: Many reviewers have commend that this book is poor in organization and explanation, I don't want to repeat. But one thing I would like to remind the potential buyers that this book includes all the past exam questions of FRM. I believe that it is the only attractive point of this book.But the explanation of the answers of the past questions are also not very good.\", \" Terrible textbook: This is the course book assigned by my college professor. I found the book to be disorganized, confusing and incomplete. Vocabulary words are often spread out throughout the chapter in odd places. The exercices will give you the question, but no sample answer so you can't understand the structure of the sentence you are supposed to be responding in. Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it. You have to look it up in the back of the book or somehow manage to interpret the difference between a picture of an aunt and your sister.If your instructor has assigned this book, you're better off getting another textbook to understand what this one is saying.\", \" Don't waste your time...: What a major disappointment this movie was. It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead.

We've seen movies like this before, and still it's a pleasure to watch the talented and handsome and strong actor Kevin Sorbo as a military leader searching for a scary soldier...Indeed, a fun movie!\", \" Complex controls don't come on after power outage: I bought this to keep the inside of my RV from freezing up during the week (we use it on weekends). After a power-outage of about 30 minutes, the unit failed to come back on so everything froze up. Since we are prone to brief outages, this was not acceptable. I replaced the Delonghi with a $20 space-heater and have not had another problem.\", \" Big Brother is watching you!!!: 1984 is about a man named Winston Smith and the totalitarian society he lives in. Winston becomes a free thinker in a society where the Thought Police will kill for doing such criminal acts. He starts to rebel against Big Brother in ways that I couldnt even believe (writing in a diary, having sex, purchasing certain items at a store). Winston's journey is a scary one from beginning to end. Part three is especially creepy. I know that this story is very extream, but it is kinda crazy how it describes things that happen in our world today.\", \" Fahrenheit 451: I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it. Fahrenheit 451 is different then what I usally read. This book has so many hidden detals in it.

But, as it is, it felt like the cinematic equivalent of a video game. If you really do want to spend 80 minutes watching some chick running then I'd suggest waiting for the next Olympics. For a German movie with some depth, rent anything by Fassbinder, Herzog or Wenders.\", ' So Sad...: How could the powers that be not see the utter genius in this show?

Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.\", ' MY SOON TO BE NEW TOY: I Cant wait till christmas then i will get my advace pet i seen what it could do so i cant wait.hey does it come with a jack in cord so u could like jack in to ur computer and add stuff.If so that joint is cool right protoman (yep)!!! hheehehehe im 14 years old and i approve this toy to be the best.', \" size of mugs: The mugs are very nice, but I guess I didn't think of the 16 oz. size, as a result they are much larger than I would have liked them...other than that they are very nice and will be put to use...\", ' Great product: This is a very good product.

The songs are suprisingly very pop-like.\", ' A Qualifier: There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don\\'t see why it\\'s so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a \"realistic\" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry.', \" Don't watch this book.: This was by far the worst science fiction novel I have ever watched. While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy. The worst part of this play had to be the end where both charaters joined up with Marty McFly to save the universe. Thumbs down to you sir!

I can\\'t say enough about how sorry this movie is. \"Tower of Blood\" is just pure rubbish!!The movie follows a familiar script, typical slasher flick format, but the acting is so bad, the film is so poorly executed and the movie is just so completely lacking in style that even the the most unsophisticated of horror movie fans will just laugh or cry (depending on how much you paid for it) after watching this trash.

The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel.

I then realized that I\\'d seen all there was to see. Don\\'t waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2.

And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that\\'s how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book. It explores the strange quirks of human psychology that make it inevitable that we will always be controlled.

So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:\"Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain\" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?', \" Check the facts: I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association.\", ' Classic Thomas Hardy: Perhaps the greatest of the works by Thomas Hardy.

I wanted to buy this portable bed and use it for everyday sleep and also as a standby couch. It's been serving the purpose well so far for the couple of weeks. I've gotta wait and see if any major leaks occur in the future.Here's the reason for the missing star. It never becomes flat or very saggy, but needs air top up daily for sure. Especially since I'm using this also as a couch to sit, sometimes I need to inflate it for a couple of minutes before going to sleep to get the firmness I want. Of course it is absolutely not as comfortable as a box spring mattress on a frame, but I can assure that this is definitely worth the bucks if the need is an inexpensive temp bed for everyday use.By the way, this very same model costs $89 in Walmart when I checked, hope now it is not!\", ' A good source of propaganda!: I have learned Java from \"Core Java\". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?', \" Slllloooowwwwwww and slower: I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen.

This was the british version, uncut.\", \" I wish I could give 0 stars: I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt.\", \" An unrealistic book that dosen't make sense: I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it.\", ' Great Update of, and Supplement to, Strunk & White: Similar in style and tone (and usefulness) to Strunk & White\\'s classic \"Elements of Style\". Short, pithy, intelligent. Lots of examples, followed by Professor Lasch\\'s thoughtful, penetrating, often witty comments. Recommended for all undergrads.', ' It could be better: Thw writer has done a marvellous job, writing the history of USAAF in one volume only, in a modern and acesible language. But there are two serious flaws: 1)there are no apendix, which could include the number of planes built, destroyed in combat, the number of enemy plane shot down, number of enlisted men at end of war, etc, etc.. 2)The photo session is so small, so ridiculous, that it should have been better to have no photos at all.', \" I do not like Finnegans Wake: I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read. If you want to be allusive, that's fine, but express yourself coherantly and in an unambiguous fashion. Ulysses and A Portrait managed to be both timelessly powerful and legible; it's a pity Joyce didn't make better use of his seventeen years.\", \" A Tedious Read: I hate Hawthorne's style of writing. It's over-bloated and self-indulgent. I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional. I'm not going to say the book is poorly written, but it's written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read. Overall, a disappointment.\", ' Not how I thought it would be: The paint is very thin which makes it hard to paint on the sidewalk, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get it to stay and then I had a hard time getting it off when I left it overnight.', ' Disappointed: What a shame that these are considered to be\" acclaimed films\"..while the color,design,etc was fine-I was.

Picture format is only in 4:3 which is ashame. Though the quality of the picture is good. Good encoding, beautifull skin tones. Pitty the lightning director is not that creative and used that awfull backlights with gobo's. The sound is in AC-3 5.1 dolby, but never impressing, and with low dynamics. It's the regular TV-mix we hear, it's not remixed for dolby 5.1 with it's extra dynamics and LFE output.I feel the band is average. The directors cut is not more than an average TV-special. All the way, wouldn't recommend it.\", \" 12 games for 9 bucks: Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. No kidding. Yeah.

Created for the \"Frat Boy\" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the \"small town girl goes to the big city\" story ,the producers did\\'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the \"T\" & \"A\".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week?

It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli\\'s \"Prince\" and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious \"Book\" explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work.', \" Who says Old Folks don't have fun: I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday\", ' Great for C Gurus...: The back cover mentions it is a book for people with \"programming backgrounds\". I thought that meant any programming language, and I figured expertise in Turbo Pascal would count, but what it should say is \"C/C++ expertise\".

If you know zilch about OOP, C, or C++, pass this one up.', \" Perfect if I Lived In Europe: Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address.

I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too.

It took 2 weeks of intensive work to try to get it to work--it never did! I even had to reinstall Windows XP! Tech support NEVER got back to me, and by the time you finally give up, its too late to return. This will make you homocidal! Don't waste your time and energy.\", \" Horrible blu-ray transfer!: This is one of my favorite Argento movies, but a horrible blu-ray transfer. Maybe the worst I've seen so far. I popped in my special edition DVD just to make sure it wasn't my imagination, and the DVD looks fantastic. I'm all for maintaining film grain, but based on a comparison with the DVD, it looks like the blu-ray artificially manufactured it (maybe it has something to do with going back to the original negative). So if you have the Blue Underground 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, don't waste your money like I did. Just stick with the DVD. And if you don't have the DVD, I highly recommend it (if you're into Italian horror movies, that is...or Thomas Kretschmann).\", ' Sony basic Hi8 Handycam Rocks!: Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes.

It would be sad if the child turns out to be attentive and learns all the wrong lessons.\", \" The weirdest plot ever and it's all true.: I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered.\", \" It's NOT the FIRST book.

Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you. A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab. Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year. From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes.

Though the book started a bit slow, it took up speed and turned into one of the best reads ever, to me. I was wondering how they would turn something so interesting and complex, and psychological into a video. They didn't. This does not, at all, represent that book. If it pretended to and I were the author, I would sue. What a travesty. Boring, schlock, Hollywood representation, turning every interesting story into the outlike of a horror movie that once sold well. Please, if you like the idea of this story, buy the book. Don't Waste Your Time.\", \" Good addition to your Brio collection.: Even though it's a bit pricey for what you get, it's a fun addition to your collection. It gives the little engineer another interesting way to manipulate a train, especially battery operated trains. I would recommend buying more than one set/box if you have alot of track - it's fun to keep changing the direction of the trains to make them follow the many different directions of track. I have one set now and plan to buy another.\", ' Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller: This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing.', \" This is rubbish: If you're a Heaven 17 fan, you're gonna be disappointed; if you like good techno, you're gonna be disappointed. It's just plain rubbish. There are one or two tracks that *might* warrant a second listening, but overall, the CD is annoying and a waste of money. Most of tracks have very little unity between H17 and the dance track, sounding like two songs mistakenly played together.\", ' Sophomoric at Best: Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author\\'s general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I\\'ve read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. \"Damn, he said to Kate, \"It\\'s the Hazar Scouts, \" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists\\' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There\\'s no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn\\'t even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy\\'s gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good', ' BRIO Curved Track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market.

I liked that they stick to the fridge but have found that means I occasionally have to wipe off pepper flakes. The small, rectangular holes make funneling refills difficult and messy. About a month into light use, the pepper mill gummed up and cleaning was a real chore. After about a year of moderate use, the pepper mill just wasn't grinding properly anymore. Cute but not very durable.\", ' Nope, nope: I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. No matter any point of view (feminists are gonna be mad) or theory this book is positing, the basis of the book is not understanding female anatomy. I have no idea if the psychological ideas have been debunked. This book was given to me as a joke a few birthdays ago. You can say \"the reason your sex is bad is because you\\'ve lost your feminine role\" and hell, that could be 100% correct, but a big chunk of this book ignores where the nerve endings are located. In the 40 years since this was published, I think someone went ahead and talked to some women, maybe even did some science-y stuff and decided 80+% of women weren\\'t just orgasming wrong.

If you\\'re looking for potty humor, watch Beavis and Butthead. This movie tries to be both, and in the end, the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray, leaving the viewer with nothing. Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a \"moral\" movie, please beware, it is far, far, from it.

In short, if your new to max then buy this book.', \" Reflections of a Vampire ROCKS!: Horror lovers everywhere, be prepared to crown another King. Damion Kirk is a master story weaver and first class writer with tremendous style. Mr. Kirk's vampires are so vivid, they crawl off the page. One even followed me into my dreams! St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours. Why did I love Reflections of a Vampire? Because it's a tale so very, very human.\", \" Overhyped?: Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.\", \" Newman is a musician worth listening to.: As a sensitive person with eclectic tastes it's easy to be impressed by Animal Dreams. It's full of original, creative surprises that restore faith in the existence of musicians courageous enough to speak with their own voice, from something deeper and broader than a desire for popularity. You can't find this CD at the music store nearest you but fortunately it's available here. I recommend Animal Dreams and Ron Newman as a musician worth listening to.\", ' CDs DO NOT HAVE SOFTWARE!!!!!: It turns out that this book only comes with Audio cds! Go figure: When the TOELF is mainly take on the CBT form', \" 5:55 Charlotte Gainsbourg: What a great album!!! I never knew she sang as well. I have seen her in French movies and enjoyed greatly her acting in those movies. Now I even adore her more, because not only can she act, but she can sing as well!!!Go Charlotte Go!!!! Can't wait for her next album.\", \" This ain't no economics book!: I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics.\", ' Sexy and Different: I earlier wrote that I did not receive these as ordered, but the seller immediately contacted me and sent this item quickly. Great service! The look is fun and sexy -- these are cut REALLY low. They will probably reveal a bit of butt cleavage, but my girlfriend and I really like the different look and feel of these quality panties. I knocked off one star because they run a bit small; order a size up if in doubt.', \" Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors.: Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is.\", \" Except for drums, awsome: Hatebreed (CONNECTICUT HARDCORE!!!!!) is amazing except for the less that spectacular drumming. Hatebreed now has a new drummer however (Woohoo!), so they're now unstopable.\", \" A real-life lesson in leadership: In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book.\", \" The proof is in the... not pudding...: The proof of a book on health issues is in the results it gets you, and it's very hard to argue with the results I've gotten from following Dr. Bernstein's plan. Many others have reviewed this book more capably than I can, but let me just say that after a few months of following Dr. B's diet, I've lost 50 lbs., gotten normal blood sugars, and feel better than I've felt in years. Highly recommended!\", \" Worst possible remake: I can't understand how anyone could get behind such a bad script. Everything is bloated, the original story by Shirley Jackson is unrecognizable, save for the names of the characters and the house. But the one thing that I did learn from this film is that Lili Taylor could play Mary Poppins -- her take on Eleanor is pure saccharine. I gave the film one star, and that was for the set of the house.\", \" A Very Suspenseful Book!: This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it.\", ' I\\'m very impressed so far: So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I\\'ve been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It\\'s comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach \"pooch\". It\\'s comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I\\'m looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I\\'ll just have to get a size small! I love it!', \" Pratchett is Magical: Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards! Guards! but I personally enjoyed Men at Arms more. This is an excellent and brilliantly imagined story.\", ' Tiny Tim in Adulthood: Mr. Timothy: A Novel was disappointing in its lack of cleverness.I always look for tidbits of humor but found nothing much in this \"angry\" immage of Tim as an adult.', ' Bad Product--great company.

He loves crocodiles so we are looking forward to playing it with him.', \" The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor...: Whoever mastered this CD had no idea what they were doing (this makes me wonder what other CDs on this label are like). They use about one-quarter of the dynamic range available with 16-bit audio. Five bucks is pretty cheap for the disc, but you get what you pay for in this case. I'd probably opt for the other Eddie Fisher CD that has multiple albums (one of them being a Christmas CD) on it.\", \" We Are Witnesses: When I picked up this book and thought I would be reading experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book.\", ' Entertaining Book: It is hard at first to keep all the characters straight but it was a good book. The portrayal of a working first time mom and the two different worlds is insightful. There were a couple surprise twists.', ' The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill!: This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!', \" The worst movie ever made: Yeah, it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids, but it isn't.It's mean-spirited movie that goes nowhere. It's crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler, but not even in a funny way. Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port-a-potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh*tsicle...then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh*t stuck in their teeth. Yup, that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein.Please don't buy this. And if you do, BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it.\", \" A must-have for everyone interested in the Stalingrad Battle: Recently I ordered 'Stopped at Stalingrad' from amazon.com. It was well worth the puchase, as the book is both a profoundly researched study and an interesting read. It's a scholarly work which, undoubtedly, will become a classic in its field.Dénes Bernád, Aviation Historian and Author\", ' Just as trashy as garbage music comes...: I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I\\'m permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They\\'re CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They\\'re millionaires because they repeat the words \"huh,\" \"what,\" and \"yeah\" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They\\'re millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what \"so-called\" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it\\'s worth your money cause I ain\\'t gonna spend a penny on it.', ' A great product!: I have been using this cleansing gel for years. I have occasionally tried other products, but keep coming back to Exuviance. My skin is somewhat sensitive and this cleanser leaves it very soft and smooth, with no irritation. Recently, I met a new esthetician who thought I was wearing makeup when I had just washed my face with Exuviance Purifying Cleansing Gel and used moisturizer! She made my day!', \" Bad written - Wasted money: I think this book isn't worth the money you pay for it. Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid. So it is a great effort reading it.I have to read this book at school and I do not have any motivation to analyze it.\", ' Flyboys: The acting and aircraft sequences are very good. I enjoyed the movie, but if it is based on a true story, then I would have to read it. I found the ending a bit \"hoakey\".

I love classic movie scores, and this is one of my favorite collections. The \"Gunga Din\" and \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" themes are so well done you can imagine each scene from the movie as it is played. These are my two favorite scores in the collection because the various themes are each given their own track. (And I already had the other scores on another compilation!) It really is a must for classic movie lovers!!!!!', ' I love this bed! carry it anywhere!: I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn\\'t need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn\\'t require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the \"airbed\", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don\\'t want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn\\'t require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one.', \" Satisfied Customer: I needed a wireless pci card to get internet access from my garage, but I got more than what I expected. My computer is about 40-45 ft. away from the actual router and is in a completely separate part of the house.

Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy.

It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time.

This book should have been named \"Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink.\" I was glad to be done with this book.

Sherwood's writing style is crude at best, with some of her sentences making little to no sense at all. There writing flows very poorly (if at all), and the metaphors are some of the worst I've seen. The dialogue is boring and simplistic. I also agree with the reviewers that said this book is unnecessarily vulgar in many places. One of the worst books I've read in a long while.\", \" Um....Hostel anyone?: This movie had basically the same storyline as Hostel, except more gore, possibly a tribute to the lines of Cannibal holocaust and such. I'm not a gore fan, but I enjoyed hostel. This movie was a complete ripoff of that one, and with no suspense or scares. This was just anotyher generic exploitation flick. The characters were 2 dimensional, only exisiting to be slaughtered, and let out the occasional yell, the story was trite, and the villain not believable. I'm sorry I wasted my time.\", ' Drivel: Jean Hill\\'s story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the \"little dog\" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie.

Ivie Anderson\\'s vocals really shine, especially on \"It Don\\'t Mean a Thing (If It Ain\\'t Got That Swing)\".

Apart from this video and the guest appearance with the Chieftans it was hard to obtain videos of Nanci in this country. I have most of her albums. This video is superb. The quality of the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is translated into the viewer\\'s experience.

I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic. And at first it mostly did. But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another...

So, from that aspect, it is very nice. now every positive normally comes with a few negatives. as you may guess, due to the size of this unit, the receiver is probably not the most powerful or accurate receiver, so you need to learn how to cope with these aspects of it. I have had cases where the receiver got confused when I was in the city (San Francisco) with a couple of tall buildings around or when I was driving around on windy roads in Sierra. But other than that it has worked fine for me and I have used it in town and country.

We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players.\", \" Struggling: I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book.

It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems...\", ' Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me: Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy\\'s face in the ads. That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching \"The Incredible Hulk\" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn\\'t. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I\\'ve seen the ad, I\\'ve nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!', \" I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....: I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me.\", ' Wasted money: The subject is trivial and boring. The writing skill mediocre.I was stuck in Sri Lanka and downloaded it by mistake when learning how to use my new kindle.

Silvia Bryan', \" one of kerouac's finest: I've heard it said that this is Kerouac's greatest novel. I still say that honor is held by On the Road, but this book is just as good. And it is his most spiritual novel. Kerouac combines his talent at writing with his philosophy of life and what you have is a powerful tool to enlightenment. This book should be read on at least two levels, as a work of great literature and as a theological tool.

In fact, so many things in this over-the-top special-effects fest fly in the face of what Ms. Jackson wrote, it\\'s an insult to say it\\'s based on her work.The first film from the 1960\\'s is one of the best ghost stories ever put on celluloid and is about 90% true to the original story, which is why it was so good. Special effects are virtually nonexistence in the first film -- and everything that happens is believable, which is why it\\'s so scary.In this new \"version,\" all the effects are so ridiculous and heavy-handed, I could only laugh!

When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested.

This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money.\", ' Misses the Mark: I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it\\'s least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these \"critically acclaimed\" dramas it\\'s missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying \"What?\"', ' Really usable: With 120 knots/bends/etc, this is perhaps not definitive, but certainly complete for almost any usage.

We've had a great time with it.\", \" Drawn out: After reading the reviews I was excited to watch this film. I found the plot to be very drawn out, predictable, and somewhat dull.

Enjoy the film.\", \" They get knocked down, please stay down again!!!!: Worst band ever, period. The final sign that the music industry cares not for talent. Basically like the fabricated Spice Girls only they could at least carry a tune. These guys can't even play a radio, just horrible.

I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better.\", ' I fell in love with this book from the first page......: TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life.

Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time.

This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood.\", \" Depression Management: This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. It is a good starting point to help a person recognize what they are feeling. The side on anxiety management is for heavy problems. It might have been better to make two different tapes, but I still would highly recommend it.I've given this tape to people who are obviously hurting. It is a way to help someone help themselves.

What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a \"real team\"; b) encouraging CEOs to create \"real\" executive \"teams\" and c) permitting \"undisciplined\" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior. There is little of value in this lightly-referenced and illogically-written tome. This is not the book to take on a long plane trip as your only reading, unless you are a big fan of command and control leadership styles.', \" This movie has it all: You know when you see some special effect or style choice in a movie or tv show or commercial that you like?

It was the fashion source that women turned to for the most current information on what to wear. If you have ever wondered what they really wore, and why they wore it then I would suggest that you look to these books for the answers. Typically these books have a full year bound together. Each month should have a color fashion plate featuring the current wardrobe fashions. They also have music, poems, short stories, knitting and crochet patterns, health tips and cooking hints. They provide a valuable insight into the era. If you are a civil war reenactor there is no better source for accurate information, and if you are just a fan of American history, these books are an outstanding source.', \" Not worth the money...: After a cheap rice cooker I had for years died, I thought I would upgrade and get this one. I wish I had heeded some of the reviews I saw on here. First of all, it is difficult to read the water level lines on the inside of the pot. I am young and thought it couldn't be that bad. It is. I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again.\", ' The ultimate \"touchy-feely\" book.: This book contains such advise as writing down personal affirmations which you will repeat to yourself at the beginning of each day:I am calm, prepared, and entertaining.I am fit and beautiful.I am humble, patient, and compassionate.I am enough, just the way I am.If this kind of advise is your cup of tea, then this is your kind of book.', \" Sansa View 8 GB: This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family.

I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder.

If you know something about James Whale or liked his movies then it will prove more interesting. The movie starts out a bit slow but then grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, but fascinating throughout. I was surprised that the gay subject-matter did not make me feel uncomfortable (as with other similarly-themed movies). Expert performances by Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave make this all the more rewarding. See this movie.

A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash.\", \" The best laid plans...: Joan Crawford chews the scenery, Jack Palance looks ugly and menacing, and Gloria Grahame slinks around in this fabulous film noir. Crawford is a wealthy socialite and playwright who marries Palance, an actor she had previously rejected from one of her plays. Turns out he has a girlfriend (Grahame) and they're plotting to murder Joan for her money. Joan finds out and decides to beat them to the punch (so to speak) by hatching a plan to murder her husband and frame his lover for the crime, complete with a little dream sequence showing the audience how it's supposed to turn out. In the middle of the plan, however, Joan loses her nerve...and that's when things get really interesting. The suspense starts about halfway through the film, when Joan discovers the plot against her, but the last ten minutes of the film dials up it a few levels. A must for any fan of Crawford and/or film noir.\", ' Jigsaw Fun from Amazon: I gave this puzzle to my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter for Easter.

First the good: Beautiful graphics (the scenery is almost like real), the campaign has a story (unlike some RTS games that have no campaign or story), skirmish mode is fun but sometimes too quick, great gameplay, and it runs nicely. The bad: The units are sometimes kind of dumb (they stand and do nothing sometimes when they are told to go somewhere), the unit graphics could have been a little more sharp, and there aren't many units (this is not really that bad but I would have liked more units; there are 9 different combat units for the Romans).

It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster.

She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story.\", \" works fine: I have an 'old' ibook from 2001, white, and even though it says for G4 on the package of the charger, it works just fine with mine.

Every song on Closer to the Truth is a powerful emotion. There is no bad song on this cd.

You will be humming the chorus all day after that song. Alberta Postcard will paint you a picture and make you want to visit Canada while There You Go will bring you back to the mortality of life. The icing on the cake is the finale (The Sun the Moon and Stars). This is their best song on the CD and will bring you to tears.

The characters are one dimensional, the acting is sluggish, the dialogue is banal and contrived, the directing is awful, but worst of all, the script is terrible. The screenplay oozes simplistic simple minded notions of political correctness and insight where there is none. Audrey Wells purports to have written a complex and surprising story with unexpected twists and turns, but what she has produced is a shallow and unsatisfying film with no real purpose other than to make the fairly obvious point that life is full of surprises and unexpected outcomes. Gee - what an insight. The characters are completely unsympathetic and the only thing that makes this film watchable at all is the backdrop of Cortona. This film entirely misses the point of the book and I just hope the author was well paid for allowing her book to be associated with this awful movie.', ' Not a trustworthy company: I bought two sets of these.

Blu ray review.: Inspired by the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, it tells the tale of America's first fighter pilots during WWI. Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties, but it is a compliment to the courage of these men. The action and aerial fight sequences are intense and exciting. You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version. If you do than you can consider if you really want to upgrade. IT'S UP TO YOU!\", ' Great price, works just as well as the Apple version: Bought this as a replacement for my ibook charger.

Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast.

It has the complete text of the play, but that's about it. It does not have any chapter select links to either act or scene, and no line numbers are provided. There are no notations or explanations.

She continues to do what she does best in this album and that's make deep and sensual music. Though personally this isn't my favorite album that she's made, however the songs Momento, Close to you, Azul, and Cade Voce in my opinion are more of the rare gems Bebel has added to her already popular arsenal of great Bossa Nova music. Any true fan of hers would be satisfied with her overall performance of this album. Keep it up Bebel!!!!!\", ' A True and Total Dud: Yes, everyone has a tale to tell, and it is the standard Binchy tale: someone is a mistress, someone *has* a mistress, someone feels trapped in his/her marriage...

I'll start off by saying that all the sped up and slo-mo effects were unnecessary and honestly annoying. The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character.

You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug.

This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with.

First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there.

As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass.\", \" Great little known tips: I am an avid gardener who has accumulated many books on the subject.

The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening.

From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.\", ' WORTH THE MONEY!!!!: My son loves Yu-Gi-Oh. He can\\'t wait to receive this for Christmas. $30.00 does seem like a lot of money for this, but the plain Yu-Gi-Oh figures are $20.00 a pack. Besides, this is the \"cool dragon\" (as my son calls it) from the movie so it is worth it to see him get so exited when he opens this.

This book is just awful, there are way too many good books to waste your time on this one.', \" Outstanding Book: From the persective of a U.S. Army Officer, I highly recommend this book. Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric\", ' this scooter it only for kids scooter only 4 weeks: I am 22 years old men and i bought this scooter for the speed by ivoog scooters for 400 dollars with free shipping, and i like it,i have this scooter two months with problems, and the only big problem is that the wheels are very small to enjoy the ride safety,controller will stop working and then the company will leave you will not help ,and will tell you what could we do.and it not comfortable because it do not have any shocks so i do not recommend it all for adults that need to ride long trip,so adults for you good do not buy any xtreme scooters they are for kids you be not happy if you buy it.i bought the ezip 1000 scooter this is the best of the best scooter, with the x500 scooter i am 140 lb i ride 17+MPH and with ezip 1000 i ride with the top speed of 16+MPH and it fille really like 20MPH, and its very very comfortable so this for you adult you will love it and you be very very happy with it you see....', \" Too obvious for even young readers: I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting.\", \" A mind altering book.: This has to one of the best books i have ever read.

Really has it in for the B-29 and Hap Arnold.', ' Gutless garbage: \"Under The Tuscan Sun\": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I\\'m sure the book was bad, but it can\\'t have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow \"Tuscan\" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn\\'t Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You\\'ve never seen the white marble of Rome\\'s Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan.

There are thousands of boring, fungible records like this released in the mid-60s from Brazil, France, etc. This is not to say that all of this type of stuff is worthless.

A beautifully produced, sumptuously photographed, beautifully designed, absolutely suffocating BORE.This is the kind of film that gives art films a bad name. It is the kind of literary adaptation that people just love to watch because it takes place in pretty locations, and is based on a book that no one has ever read but is acclaimed as a classic in the advertisements, and is very very very very very very long, and takes itself very very very very very very very seriously, and is just generally so very busy being so very ARTISTIC that is forgets little things like plot and characterization. I did not care about anyone or anything in this pompous load of nonsense.I was not really expected to, of course. The filmmakers are more interested in attracting tourists to France than in creating a living work of cinema.Avoid this film.', \" Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate.: Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs.

I was so scared, I could not leave the bed until my parents arrived back, hours later.I must be honest, ventriloquist dummies still scare me to death.

The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner. There is little that is new here. It is just regurgitating the same stuff.

Kalinnikov & Arensky came to mind as I listened to this piece for the first time, and as I listened more and thought less of Russian comparisons and more of De Boeck, the music still strikes me as Russian in the shapes of the melodies, the style of the orchestration, and in the development of the themes. I haven't as yet spent enough time with the violin concerto to feel adequate to advance an opinion, but can assuredly say that if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music you will probably enjoy the symphony and rhapsody, and the adverb 'probably' has no place in this sentence if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music from Russia. For in that case, you will certainly enjoy this music.\", ' Better than New: I borrowed a copy of this book from a friend who said it only had 2 readings.When my \"used\" copy arrived through Amazon, it was like new, even betterthan my friend\\'s.

It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. \"I won\\'t let you kill any more children, Ukraine!

Funny, witty and covers everything from start to end.', \" 1984 defines our distrust for government: The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives.\", ' poor workmanship!: These sheets looked pretty until they fell apart the first time I washed them. How does a sheet fall apart? Well, in this case the raw edges were left exposed in several areas when the hems were put in. The exposed fabric, which is loosely woven to start with, simply unraveled.

I read this book when I was in 6th grade, what made me be able to get through it was the fact that the character Ayla was so well built and that I was able to believe she was real and that those thing's actually happened to her. The rest of the character's were good too but Iza and Ayla were my favorite. I am in 8th grade now and have read the four book's in the series that have came out, and I'm waiting for the 5th to be written so I can read it! when I read this book I couldn't set it down. Don't worry about letting young children read it, I read it when I was young and I was able to get over the troubling part's. I actually think it is very educational. Jean did a great job on reaserch and wrote a very interesting, fun book. I reccomend it\", ' classic bit of entertainment: Adventure movie based on book, pretty much plot for plot.

I can\\'t drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom\\'s (the cousin) guilt, and these \"mystery 4 men\". I was glad to hear a book had been written from \"their\" point of view. When I say \"their\" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes.', \" Scarlet Letter review: Haven't finished the book, but love it. Little Pearl is my favorite character. The language is a little unfamiliar but very descriptive and eloquent. Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times.\", \" the movie was better: Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away.

As a kid, this was my favorite book about adventures in space. I just re-read it, and was amazed at the depth of presentation in a book easily enjoyed by children. The Venusian frame of mind is both alien and understandable. The ideas of boys becoming men, confused and excited by their new surroundings is real. And the approach to civic duty that a young officer learns, and his total inability to explain it to some civilians, is heart-breakingly real.\", \" I used to eat it till I found out how it was made: diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that's what it is.

I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it.

That honor goes to \"Blackheart Man\". But \"Marketplace\" does contain some fine pop-reggae tunes such as Stay With The Reggae, Electric City, and Jump Jump. Plus the album cover is great! I recommened picking this up if you can find a copy.', ' Loved This one, but I hated the \"Ark Of Truth.\": Unlike Ark Of Truth this movie was very good, I loved the story line, the acting was great and seeing Jack again was the icing on the cake. If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story. Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it\\'s orginal cast.', \" Men's High Tec Boot: This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking.

This book did not show the basics.

I was having difficulty hearing and also getting a comfottable fit with the included ear hook that came with my Jabra JX-10 Series II Bluetooth headset. I removed the hook and attached one of the 6 gels that came in the pack to the headset and found that the volume increased 40% and I was able to achieve a comfortable fit. The headset is small enough and light enough that the gel holds the headset in the ear. I was about to give up on this headset (and all earhook type Bluetooth headsets) prior to getting the gels. If you are looking for a comfortable (and econimical) alternative for earhook type headsets, I strongly recommend that you give these a try. They are well worth the price.', ' I like them a lot-- one of my fave CDs: I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is \"When I Grow Up.\" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook.', \" Alittle More Of This and Alittle less of That: Bad Azz is dope and getting better everytime i hear him, however in my opinion its his beats and track selection that will halt his progress in terms of album sales and flava. His first album was good but suffered the same as this album in the fact that there are too many tracks that sound the same because they are so laid back and really lacking alittle liveness or crunkness even though this maybe the style of beat Bad Azz chose because he describes ghetto struggle so well. The best tracks are 'Streetz Illustrated', 'Wrong Idea' and 'How We Do It' with afew others close behind. If Bad Azz can include afew more tracks like these on his albums then he will start to really shine. Buy this album still, because the good tracks are Phat!!!\", ' Did not like: Just not my type of book. Very boring but I got through it. Hard to stick with it until the end.', \" Nothing special about the special affects: Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay.\", ' Truly disappointing: This was a truly disappointing movie. How could anyone take Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, add great special effects, and end up with a boring movie? Just awful.', ' Not as good as most: I love Little Critter books, but this one isn\\'t as good as most. It is cute, and my kids like it fine, but others are better. I think my favorite are the ones titled \"Just Me and....\"', ' Blurred Audio: Audio is technically flawed. The instumental sounds are Not crisp and clear. The musical selections and the Ellington orchestration are excellent. But the unclear Audio makes listening to this album like viewing a blurred, out of focus photograph. Definitely NOT a worthwhile selection for serious Duke Ellington afficionados.', ' Low Budget: Some good action and scenery, but otherwise pretty low budget movie. Only recommended for die-hard horror fans.', \" Made Me Feel Worse!: A friend suggested this herb to me to help with my awful PMS. After taking Vitex for only three days during PMS, I began to feel horrible: very irritable, nauseous and foggy. After doing some research, I found that a percentage of women react very negatively to this herb -- some people remarked that they initially felt better, but then progressively felt worse and thought they were going crazy; some said they immediately felt terrible. I guess it's a gamble that many of us are willing to take to feel better though. Wish it had worked!\", ' Great Story - You will enjoy it.: This was a great book. Although the story takes place about 35,000 years ago you can see lots of parallels to events in our lives today.

Long-term Planning for Your Parents is a easy to read guide for families who are planning ahead or those who need to make informed decisions quickly about long term health care/living arrangements. What makes this booklet unique is its focus on the emotional issues that your family will be facing when trying to make end of life decisions for your parents. Long-term Caring for Your Parents includes information on talking about money, negotiating the health care and government bureacracy, and dealing with family dynamics. The booklet contains practical tips, resources for more information, and a place to write notes and do research. I would recommend this booklet for parents and adult children, work/family resource professionals, and companies who provide resources for their employees on balancing work and family.', ' Great Movie But Awful Sound Quality by KINO: This is one of those great film noir classics and Crawford gives one of her great performances. However, all of this is marred by the poor sound quality by Kino. I had to turn up the volume on my TV all the way to hear it. Crawford (in her last Oscar nominated role) and this superb film deserve much better.', ' Insulting RIP OFF: With the over 50 GIGS of memory on a Blu-Ray, Paramount could easily fit the first 11 or 12 TV Specials on one disc, but being the crooks they are, they prefer to screw the American consumer by retailing 29.99 for ONE 25 minute episode, one 12 minute interview and a sub par \"Christmas Special\" made 20 years AFTER the original masterpiece. Shameful.', ' Ok dvd/blu-ray but digital copy will NOT work. Codes are expired!: I specifically got this version of the movie for my husband so he could have the movie on his iphone. The code expired in September and they are still selling it to people as dvd+blu-ray+digital copy. But you cannot get the digital copy because of the expired code. If you wanted the file for itunes like we did, DO NOT BUY!!!', ' Good revenge-type movie: If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him. This movie was a really good revenge movie. The only problem I had with it was trying to make out what was being said. It is done in \"Australian language\" and, though it is basically English, the accents of most except for Mel Gibson\\'s character are so strong that you really have to over-listen to try and figure out what is being said. Other than that, the movie was a good movie and the crash scenes were fantastic for the era in which it was made. I only wish I could have understood what everyone was saying without straining in order to get even half of the dialogue. But, it is a movie well worth viewing.', ' very poor: would not buy it.Not worth the money.Did not tell me all the things that I could see in the cities.Would not recommend to anyone.', \" Lame talk, the music speaks for itself: This is a very dissapointing DVD. If they allowed you to have songs without commentary interruption it might be ok, or if there was any 'previously unreleased' music on it. Even if they just had the pictures, film and diary entries with the music it would be ok. But there's no reason to watch this DVD more than once if you have to listen to all the commentary each time. The Band of Gypsy DVD has two options, Concert Footage only and Concert Footage with Commentary. Jimi's music speaks for itself, and no one can come close to him, so it's not necessary to hear what people have to say about him. The music and maybe the pictures as background are enough.\", \" Great Costume!: This is a fabulous costume! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week. She even slept in it a couple of nights. The other reviews are correct in saying that it needs some mending. We had to reinforce the velcro on the mask and the elastic on the bottom of the boots. After a little stitching it is fine. We also sewed on a small piece of material to the back of the face mask so that it wouldn't stretch any further and tear. This was a fabulous idea. Do it! I only deducted one star for this because the rest of it is great. The material is a durable shiny pink. My daughter is a size 4 and wears a size 9 shoe and the small fits perfectly. If she were a 5 or older I would get the medium. Totally worth the money.\", \" Wrong item!: After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd.

I popped the disc in my PC to take a look, and discovered the movie was only 2.8GB. What was Paramount thinking? A DVD can hold 8+ GB. The more space that's used, the higher the bitrate. A low bitrate results in poor image quality. So, what we get is a DVD that's nearly empty, and a highly compressed mess of a movie. Thanks for nothing, Hollywood.\", \" Not so hot: I confess I didn't play past the first level, but here's why. The colors are so bright in this cartoon-graphics game, it can give you a headache. Then on the first level, a dinosaur kept coming out of nowhere and jumping on my Taz, delaying the game as Taz recovered. There's no warning this is going to happen, and no way you can defend yourself. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but if I have problems on the very first level, it just isn't right. And if you get motion sick easily...well, Taz pretty much spins a lot. Enough said!\", ' Naptime: Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest. I stopped reading after the first 3 chapters because sleep kept invading my read time.', ' Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. It is very reminiscent of the debut, but the more I listened to it, the more it was a little too much on the techno side. Shirley\\'s voice saves that, though. The 1st track \"Temptation waits\" reminded me a lot of the power that \"Supervixon\" had, & \"Special\" was better before radio started killing it. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn\\'t disappointed with this cd. Garbage just plain rocks.', ' Hi-Tec, the best !: Hi-Tecs are the BEST, the coloring has come out of these, now kinda of a weird green color (?), but they have a good tight fit, did a week in them @ Isle Royale last summer !

Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one.', \" Not Impressed: This book does not have line numbers. In addition, the pages don't have the scene or act number on them. So when you open up the book, you have no idea where you are in the play. You have to flip through pages and find the closest scene 1 so you can figure out which act you are in and then go from there.

What am I suppose to do with this combo after I buy the next? You and Peter Jackson must share the same marketing people.', ' Feel the Heat of Words: I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy.', \" The best series of books out there: This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time.\", ' A Review: My name is Laura, and I am doing this review for my english pre ap summer assinment from JMS.

Though at parts I was lost I did love the book, and I would definately recommend it to some one else.', ' FAHRENHEIT 451: Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction.', ' One Was Good, So I Bought Another-Big Mistake: I purchased the first airbed and found it to be exactly what I wanted.

First of all, there's Poseidon. This CG bill shut is an outrage to humanity. His rolling waveface accompanied by Assanti's pitiful attempt to weep provides an outstanding performance which may (being optimistic) top the emotion found in a dramatic episode of Mr. Rogers. I am certain that if poor old (really old) Homer were given a second life to live in this century, he would probably waste it by inflicting himself with chimera. With all due respect, though none is due, this film is pathetic. That's all I have to say.

I also bought two packages of pillow cases, the comforter, two shams and a valance to match. What a big mistake. It was a total waste of money and I will never buy anything from Tommy Hilfiger again. The seams on the sheets (BOTH top and bottom) started unravelling after only THREE washes. The elastic on the bottom sheet came unsewn. I took the second set of sheets out thinking maybe it was just a freak thing that I got two bad sheets. The same thing happened with the second set. Also, the quilting on the comforter came completely unravelled after a couple weeks. The fabric of the sheets faded SO fast and they looked like I had had them for years. I will *never* spend my hard earned money on the Tommy Hilfiger brand name again. They are expensive to buy but are very cheaply made and fall apart right away. What a waste.', ' Not a \"Bible\" by any means whatsoever: This book says it is a \"look\" and that what it is. By no means is it the Bible or even a beginner\\'s guide to the 1911.

If you want to learn about the \"use, care, and maintenance\" of the 1911, look elsewhere. The internet is better than this book.', ' I know I was supposed to be impressed, but....: This movie just didn\\'t grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan\\'s work, and like Fraser\\'s style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blasé film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan\\'s Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying \"who cares?\" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character\\'s plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that\\'s no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon.

For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states.

What\\'s truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There\\'s an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a \"wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband\" sort of vibe.

And in night mode, everything moves in slow motion. Overall, the quality was not that great, even in day-time shooting.I have a regular Sony Hi8 cam, and its low light and night capabilities are 100 times better.

The solitude of it all, the courage to run with pain and complete the task at hand, the enjoyment of simple pleasures of mountain running - these are all brought home in vivid detail through this account.

When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system.\", ' Belva Plain has done it again - another great story!: Once again, Belva Plain has written a compelling family storythat was hard to put down.

You won\\'t be disappointed.', \" public speaking book: I actually didn't finish this book. It had some good pointers within it but I felt it was doing more story telling than teaching me how to calm down and deliver a speech without my breakfest or lunch wanting to errupt.

Never mind that the protagonists work at sex club, they are just two crazy kids in love. If you want to read a traditional romance novel where the character's pasts as S and M enthusists are hinted at, this is your book. I was trully surprised at how convential this book was and expected more from Ann Rice. The ending was particularly silly and Harlequin-esq.\", ' Insightful: Thought this book was excellent.

Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day.\", \" Simply Fantastic!: It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend.

Thanks again:)\", \" What a disappointment: My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground. Aside from that the characters held no interest for me, a 47 year old. The overdone running scenes comprise about 50% of what is a rather short-running film to begin with. Decent Dolby 5.1 effects. Look for something else!\", \" The Genius of Asimov: I had read the Foundation trilogy when I was a teenager/early 20's. The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade. For someone who hasn't read him before, Foundation is a wonderful introduction.

My hairdresser highly recommended this, and all I have to say to her is, don\\'t give up your day job to become a movie critic! Total garbage.', ' Under the Tuscan Sun: This was one of the most predictable, syrupy, twisted excuses for a movie I have seen in a long time. Based on unlikely premises, this movie is about a woman who gets the very raw end of a divorce (we\\'re supposed to feel sorry for her within the first 3 minutes of the movie) and then takes a vacation (courtesy of her gay lover friends) and buys a villa in Tuscany based on a whim. Somehow she has enough lire to fix things up, enough moxie to make friends with Italians (?) and live in a small town. In case the audience doesn\\'t \"get\" that men are cruel and heartless, she has yet another experience with a philandering man whom she has fallen for (but never bothered to tell him). Finally her pregnant gay friend from San Francisco (now herself jilted by the \\'man\\' in her relationship) comes and delivers her baby in Tuscany, creating a \\'family\\' that our protagonist always wanted in theory. Gimmie a break. This movie rates one star because the scale doesn\\'t go lower.', \" Boring: I thought this book was long, drawn out, and boring. It was too descriptive. To me, the writing style is a lot like Jane Eyre. I don't particularly like that type of book.Plus, it was way too sad and unrealistic.

Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great.

Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot.

I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough.

The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style.

To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact.

Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it.\", ' The Only Dummy Is The Writer: \"Magic\" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky\\'s twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn\\'t help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that\\'s neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins\\' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book.', \" Worth Reading: Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community.\", \" Good? You bet. Great? Not sure ...: I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin.\", ' kindle edition warning ...no pictures: what permissive issues could ban all photos...a crock to scam full price from Kindle users.

While basic MIDI information is in there, it is so out of date it just makes it hard to read.

My spouse secretly thought that this Sheri Bayles was trying to ruin her child's birth. The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life..

This one is probably my favorite in their whole catalogue. Dreamy Psychedelic and heartbreakingly beautiful in places. I will never get tired of this recording. Maurice Deebank is an incredible underrated guitarist and Lawrence is perfect at what he does. A truly great recording that the average listener will never understand. Genius!', \" Appalling: This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.\", ' Lots of up-to-date knots: It includes lots of up-to-date knots. You can find the knots you want in a easy way. Also, the knots are categorized by the uses of them by which you can find the common usage of those knots.

Peter.', ' cuts to the heart: It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, \"Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)\" Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an \"easy\" book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as \"electric\"--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten.', \" Complex Love: I have seen all movie versions about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and still love the book everytime I revisit the story. Every word captivates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story. Read this classic tragedy!\", ' Please make it stop!!!: I\\'m sorry but Ray J can\\'t sing worth a damn.

They refused him any replacement, partial payment to fix it, no solution to the problem.

I liked the bio-enhancements that the characters get. The concept is very interesting to think about. There is a theory on how the human race came to earth, as well as a war going on in space unknown to those on earth. I think that any Sci Fi fan will enjoy reading this story.', \" Very good: I ordered 2 sets of samples. Everything came in time, & I was very pleased. The seller even included a ton of free extras too, which I was very happy about :]. The products themselves are 'pretty good'. I recommend the shampoo/conditioner & the foaming face wash [my favorite]. Overall, a very good seller. I'll probably be buying the foaming face wash which was amazing, but everything else was just average.

Great graphics and The planet just aches out for me to be on and explore', \" Fun movie, bad Blu-Ray: I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable.

Patrick Stewart makes a terrific Captain Ahab, seething with a personal obsession with the white whale, and the rest of the cast is quite good, too. The film is faithful to the book and the production values are excellent. Highly entertaining.\", ' Good book if you look into it.: The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it\\'s language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this \"perfect\" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester\\'s admiting her guilt as compared to her \"lover\\'s\" hiding his guilt. I\\'m not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don\\'t let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good.', ' Say what??!!: Well, I don\\'t understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it.

Yes, I have a regular practice. May I suggest Rodney Yee\\'s \"Yoga For Athletes\"? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be, but superior in production, and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it.', \" boring. boring. and....yes boring.: I don't know what type of movies these people watch but this movie was NOT scary, it had NO suspense, and was just plain boring. I even had low expectations going into this. A horror movie about monsters in a cave. Geez, there's an original idea. Anyways, maybe it's because it was all about women only that women reviewers are giving it such high remarks. I don't know. Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV. Now THAT movie is scary, and NOT boring.\", \" Great at first...not so good over time: Perhaps I got a bad one? A factory second? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine, it was great, just as advertised, helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist. I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture, too, although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space! However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness. My entire right front is pushing outwards on that, making a vertical bulge; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed. I don't know what could be happening.\", \" Bleh!: Honestly, I'm shocked that this production has received such high praise. I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it.\", ' Slow, Overwritten Drama: It started with a great plot...until he actually wrote it. It was overwritten (it takes pages before something happens) and the protagonists were hard to like. Boring, sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose. There are a couple twists, but the main characters are such morons, it underscores the little action that does happen.', \" Kerouac is not that great: Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing.\", ' Soso: Where i enjoy the workout and feel it working i am upset that o ordersd from this site.

This is one of the best stories of the series. I've watched it twice and am eager for a third time.It's great to see Jack back, of course.

It belongs to the kind of sci-fi, which is really imbued with meaning and consequence. Thus I would group it with other great, litterary accepted, sci-fi novels, like \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" or \"Brave New World\". I was quite surprised about the abrupt ending of the novel. I think it\\'s too short. It\\'s kind of like a novella. While reading I was thinking whether there is an allusion to the tremendous fear or reds and the communists during the 50\\'s in the U.S.?', ' \"Hallelujah!\" is what I said when I finished this book: This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a \"CLASSIC\"?', ' Not the best shaper: This would be great if it had boning in it. I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when I put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist.

Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh.

You never get a real sense of what labor and birth are really like. Comfort measures and breathing techniques are extremely limited. All she does is lecture to this class. The format is boring and the content limited.There are better ways to prepare for childbirth.', ' Great little square for the price: When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo \"satin chrome\". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6\" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality.', ' A short story....: A wonderful story but somewhat short. Take out the illustrations and the total story would be two or three pages long. But I love some of the old tales and I love cats, so this was a must for my library. The Puss In Boots reminds me of the tricksters of Native American tales. Enjoy!', ' holy crap.: This book was so incredibly scary. It could\\'ve been just me being scared easily, but they should change the name of tis book to \"Stories to Scare th Crap out of Kids\"Seriously.', \" One of the best C.D.'s I've heard in a long time!!!!: This is the best C.D. on earth!! I listen to it all the time. I like this one better than their self titled because it's got more techno in it, so you can really dance to it. Also, it's a little more upbeat than their last one. There's more of a variety in the music. It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9). Every track is a good one, and there's some meaningfull lyrics as well. Do yourself a tremendous favor and BUY THIS C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\", \" Worst movie I've ever seen: This movie was HORRIBLE! I don't know how anyone could give it 5 stars. This movie was the worst 2 hours of my life. I expected more out of an Adam Sandler movie. I felt like I was watching 2 movies at once. Any time someone asks me about this movie I tell them it's a waste and to rent something else.\", \" Intex Pillow Rest Airbed: This is the exact product we were looking for. It's compact, self filling, and pretty comfortable. It's perfect for traveling or when company spends the night. It provides the extra sleeping accommodations we needed. The 120v pump fills the bed quickly. The battery pump or foot pump wouldn't have worked well for us.\", ' May not appeal to toddler: My 3-year old toddler loved playing \"snatch-the-toast\" from her toy toaster so I bought her the crocodile dentist. However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on.', \" Ian McKellen shines hauntingly.....: What a movie. I was so tremendously moved by the characters, both haunted by their past, tortured by the present and yet still eager to experience, learn and enjoy life..... an affirmation for living a life that's full and making your mental baggage work for you. Loved it !\", \" Man Kzin IX: After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors.\", \" DON'T BUY: This fan is junk! The high speed didn't work to start, the lights don't shut off completly, which drains the battery, now it doesn't work at all! This is all only after 1 day of use!\", ' LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT: I have to say that this Musiq\\'s best cd so far. His lyrics are just so...real. Unlike rappers... he doesn\\'t sing about the same thing over and over...he sings about real situations....like is \"babymother\" OMG I LOVEEE that song...KEEP IT UP MUSIQ!!!!', \" R?: What the heck? This movie is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I'm not allowed to get or see this movie, which was only mediocre to begin with. Great job!\", \" Outstanding!: If the human condition under extraordinary circumstances interests you, then this book is a must. It's kind of a non-sequitur in the context of the whole Asian saga, but I found it to be absolutely captivating, and a couple of the main characters make a later appearance in Noble House.\", ' It keeps working!: The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively.The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards, one 512 MB, one 256 MB. Both worked in the beginning, then days later generated corrupt image files. (Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review)By the way, I own a G3, and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech, Viking, and the Lexar 12X I just received.', \" If you want a higher ASVAB score get this book!: I am currently DEPed into the US Navy.Before taking the ASVAB, I took several online practice exams, as well as the first practice exam inside this book. I didn't do too well on certain portions of the exam.Focusing on the things I had trouble on, and brushing up on the rest of the stuff, I studied for about a month.When I went to take my ASVAB for the first time, I did well on every exam, making a 94 AFQT (scored higher than 94% of applicants).I absolutely recommend this book. It provides more knowledge than is needed to pass the test, and keeps things interesting with side-notes, trivia, and funny comments.\", \" Terrible Book!: Author doesn't believe in any biological interventions and feels you should just accept you kid's disability and get on with it. Needs to spell check his work also.\", \" This book could have been something special...: It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own.\", \" not really worth it: I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.\", \" Exactly what's wrong with Literary Scholars: This book is long. Long and pointless. Sure, it's fun to sit down and make up words, or compose stream-of-consciousness relayings of dreams we've had, but why would anyone want to read them?And, anyway, any book with a quote on the back from Harold Bloom is not worth MY time, at the very least. That man is a menace, and so is James Joyce. Thinkers thinking about thinking. Not real people, not real thoughts, no significance, no soul. Pointless, long, and forgettable.\", \" Poor Quality: Just bought this toy for my son's birthday. The tower is very top heavy and won't stand up. They give you adhesive strips to stick to your wall/window. If the box wasn't torn by my son this would definetly be returned.\", ' Unheard talent: Being a huge fan of Green Carnation and Agalloch, I decided to pick up this album and their \"Heart Of The Ages\" album at the same time. Honestly, this album seems like exactly what you would get when you cross those two bands. Impressed? Yes, overall this album was pretty awesome. The dark atmosphere was perfectly created. The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop. Overall though, this album was a great purchase and is a must have for any fans of Agalloch, Green Carnation, or Katatonia.', \" Disappointed: I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The production quality is quite low - the volume fluctuates and there are are very few visuals. It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor. Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price.\", \" Works great with my Compaq Presario with Windows Vista sp2: I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn't detect my router.This one immediately did work after installing the drivers. Granted I've only had it for a week, but am very pleased. Our router is at the bedroom which is in the other end of the house (my desktop is in the bedroom opposite side) and the signal is awesome!!!\", ' Gyroscope: The gyroscope was shipped and received very quickly. The product was in excellent condition. Just like the ones I played with when I was younger. My nephew loved it. Thanks.', \" Disappointed !: As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item. The interview disc is poor quality and was basically audio from existing early interviews which most fans would have already. The content is dated and is pre reunion.The book has some nice pictures which again, are all pre 'comeback'I would'nt really recommend the item to existing fans, there is'nt really any content of interest. The cover card was scraped on arrival and looked shabby despite having been well packaged.\", \" Will not completely deflate: I ordered 3 of these. They are sturdy, comfortable, and stay inflated. The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and (almost) deflates them. The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However, if you want to completely deflate them for storage, that can be a real trick. I could never deflate any of them completely, so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is. A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty. The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air, the tighter the flap seals the port, sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I feel better after attacking one with scissors...\", ' Boring Characters: I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future? Are we going to rely on a bunch of idiots to take us into the far reaches of space? Is mister Renolds watching too many soap operas on TV?', \" So simple, yet so fun: We went to a pool with a dear friend. She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it.\", ' Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing: We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!', ' Buddy the cat is the best: I heard about the CD with clips and an interview with Ry Cooder on NPR and immediately ordered it. The book and CD are just great. As a union member myself I was glad to have a musical record of some of the history of the movement, which has not been taught for years in the schools. Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless. The travelers have many adventures, and Buddy gets thrown in jail for being \"red,\" such a great joke on the union busters. Enjoy! I sent another copy to my brother in California, he loves it too.', ' Fantastic!: Fantastic book! I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! This book is definitely going to be the start of an excellent series. The novel is based back in Venice, just around the decline of the Byzantium era. My favorite characters were without a doubt Manfred and Erik.This book is an excellent buy!', ' Fall: A Brilliant Album that I proudly promote on my shows. I can play any track and loveeeeeee it. \"Average Joe\" is one that has my listeners asking for again. Going to start promoting \"She Loves it in the Morning\" as that is the single Clay has out. If you are looking for great country \"Fall\" is an album you should have in your collection.', \" Poor Quality: I bought several of these for my daughters hoping that they would be like the one that I have used for the past 40 years. The design is the same, but the quality was terrible....way to flimsy, they didn't hold their shape (spring) for more than 5 minutes of use. I am greatly disappointed.\", \" A disappointment: Is this an exercise video? It moves too slowly with too many breaks to give a decent workout to the intermediate bellydancer.Is this a dance instruction video? It assumes you already know a good bit about bellydance, and leaves the beginner to improvise too much.The only part I found helpful, as the previous regular user of several other bellydance videos, was the veil and finger cymbal portion. I'm thinking of buying some finger cymbals now!\", \" Continuum: Good fun. There's action amd tension and lightness to make gripping and entertaining a storyline that might otherwise be somewhat predictable. Ben Browder in particular manages to inject pathos and humour as well as being delightful eye candy.Highly recommended.\", ' Very disappointing: I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). What a disappointment! One side of the blade had very visible tarnish and reddish blue spots (not sure whether rust or previously used). It also has a very light and extremely cheap look with poor manufacture. It is made in France, but it goes to show that junk comes out from there just as easy as from China, Pakistan or anywhere else. True you get what you pay for, but this one wouldn\\'t be worth even 2 bucks at a yard sale. Maybe it was a defective unit, but I didn\\'t want to take a chance with a replacement. I never even tried to use it, and simply returned it. To Amazon\\'s credit, their return process was great. Just follow the online \"return\" process, print the (free/prepaid) return label, and take it to any USPS station. Amazon\\'s service earned the second extra star.', ' Too much noise for nothing?: Reading the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it... I have to admit, that the exoticism of the \"haunting\" style of interpretation can be captivating to the ones not familiar with the Mexican or Latin-American musical traditions. However, the various musical styles appropriated in this CD merit greater diversity in interpretation.', ' reread of Helter Skelter: Many years ago, this was a popular,horrible event. Just wanted to read it again as an older person so see if my images had changed of the book.', \" I don't understand all the hoopla surrounding this book.: This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype.\", \" Anyone Who Gave This More Than 3 Stars...: ...is a lie and the truth isn't in them!!This movie was awful. From begining to end. Even the title didn't match. Marine? He was a Marine for all of 5 minutes of the movie!! LOL. But that isn't the worse part.The acting was terrible. Even the good actors (Robert Patrick) played terrible roles. The plot was unbelieveable, the action was unbelieveable, and the comedy was corny. I think the problem was the script itself, but I think GOOD ACTING could have pulled it off.As always I encourage people to see it, but don't spend your money on it. It's garbage.\", \" Lots of adjectives, adverbs, and cliches: The story itself was interesting, but the book is not well written. The author pads out half her sentences with adjectives and adverbs that are meant to add feeling that she apparently doesn't believe the facts will convey. She also seems unaware of the many cliches she uses. A potentially compelling story, written in an irritating, amateurish style.\", \" Does not work with palm easily: Did not work with my Palm T|C right away.I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C.\", \" Total garbage! Software terrible. No support. Don't buy!: I bought this adapter and it is going right back to Amazon. I installed it and the software would not load properly. I have a 6 month old HP machine running Vista. After searching the net, I found Vista drives, but they didn't work, either.What a piece of junk.I bet the hardware is fine, but without good software, forget it.I bought a Linksys WMP54G.\", \" pretty rough, but it shows promise: The playing is merely competent, and the singing sounds like jump rope chanting much of the time. But there are flashes of inspiration. It's unlikely any of these songs will stay with you after the CD is over, nor will you feel much of a draw to put it on again.\", ' No batteries calculator!: My husband had these as a kid. If you push the buttons down, the answer becomes visable through the plastic. Durable and great for our kids to practice math with.', \" Easy to hold rattle: This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. This makes my grandson want to crawl after it. It's well made, makes a nice rattling sound. I would buy it again for my grandson as it is quite nice. He didn't show interest in it until about 7 months and now that he is one plays with it a bit. The only negative comment I have is that he loses interest in it after a very short time.\", \" Lousy Book!: I searched all over to find a book specifically about voodoo in New Orleans, and unfortunately this was all I could find...it's only 240ish pages and I still haven't even made it through it yet. Though there are some interesting facts, I think it's poorly written -- and it's 50 years old! Would like to see a more updated version that is a better read. Maybe will write it myself!\", \" Not recommended: Pro: Soft-closing valve mechanism prevents water hammer effect.Cons: Programming is not intuitive. Cannot adjust the manual valve-open time duration; it is fixed at 15 minutes (the manual states it is possible to adjust this, but I did not see how). 9V battery didn't last a week.\", \" Kids love it: It's Thomas! Kids love it. I can tolerate him better than Barney or those Wiggles. Still sounds so odd to hear George Carlin narrating a children's movie...\", ' Comfortable... if not for the deflation.: I received the bed, and I loved it. But after one night it almost completely deflated. I tried to find the holes but I found none, so it was kind of a waste of money.', ' Gardening lawn book: Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again.', ' remembered from High School (eons ago): I purchased a Kindle because I am having surgery on both hands, and this was one of the first items I downloaded. I have enjoyed reading it again and look forwaed to other free classics from the Kindle store - way to go Amazon!', \" Absolute Garbage: There are plenty of tension rods out there. The _only_ advantage of the Umbra rods is that they look better. (Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them, and they are readily available elsewhere, and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or, to put it differently, they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse, the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail, anything you have suspended by the rod will come down. If it's a lightweight drapery panel, you may be in luck. Otherwise, forget about it.\", \" Ralph does it again!!: My two boys, ages 5 and 2, are big fans of Ralph Covert and his music. We enjoyed Ralph's 1st CD and are wild about his 2nd CD. We play both CDs all the time and the entire family sings along to all the tunes. This CD is a great buy!! Pick up Ralph's first CD, too, if you don't already own it. No music loving family should be without Ralph's music!!\", ' Great Wireless PCI card: It is a wonderful and for the price, nothing can beat it.I had other USB adapters installed before and never have great reception as this does.Highly recommend.The MSI software needs a little attention but if you follow the procedures, you should be fine. Took no more than 15 minutes to get every thing ironed out.', ' Outstanding Sequel!: This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :)', ' Possibly the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen: I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It\\'s the worst highly rated movie I\\'ve ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying \"WTF?\" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better.', \" Don't be fooled this is just a documental: No one song complete, just short clips and explanations about the making of the album, nice but not for a dvd, at least in my humble opinion.\", ' The Alchemist: Sure this is an interesting book. Unfortunately the copy we received was written in spanish!', ' Waste of time.: I bought this video while thinking to myself, \"hot chicks beating the crap out of each other, sweet\". Well, none of these things turned out to be the case. The chicks aren\\'t hot, in fact one either used to be a man, or still is a man. The violence is limp to say the least. Imagine an episode of cops where neighbors at the trailer park are in a domestic disturbance. The problem is that the girls aren\\'t athletes, nor do they seem to care much if they win. Stay away, this is just some dude with a camcorder attempting to get you to part with your money.', \" Children's Version! Not for the literary afficianado...: I was trying to find an illustrated version of the original Chaucer as a wedding gift for a friend of mine, and found this one. I didn't realize (my fault--it's in the Publisher's Weekly review) that this was a child's version of the classic. The illustrations are nice, and, quite frankly, I haven't read the author's interpretation, but I wanted to make it clear to folks that it's not the original text, nor even an unabridged translation.\", ' Red Allen\\'s hot session: Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson\\'s orchestra (\"Queer Notions\" and some other songs).This is a really hot and swinging Henry \"Red\" Alllen\\'s slightly dixielandish date, featuring Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax) J. C. Higginbotham (trombone), Buster Bailey (clarinet), Cozy Cole (dm), as well as some younger but still hot players.However, the leader is particularly expressive in the ballad \"I Cover the Waterfront\" - no wonder I found it cited as one of the classical Allen\\'s performances. Late fifties were good not only for modern explorations: this hot hi fi session gives great joy to us fans of classical jazz who sometimes whish that the recording technology in the 20\\'s and 30\\'s was a bit more advanced...', \" Do the gods make man or does man make the gods or ....: I've read quite a few of the Pratchett books, mostly at the insistence of my 13 year old son who loves these novels. This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read.\", \" Not for me...: These probably work great for some people, but they didn't for me. None of the three sizes gave me just the right fit and I ended up going back to the factory gel that came with the device.\", \" Not good: If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing.\", \" Not the best book ever: My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag.\", \" Who's Laughing?: This is an ongoing hoax perpetrated, sustained and constantly embellished by a Literary Establishment who simply wish to award each other doctoral degrees in pretending to understand this mishmash of a book. It may very well be the worst thing ever published. It is certainly the worst thing ever published with college courses based around it.\", \" Quit working after 3 hours: The adapter quit working after 3 hours of use. I returned it and got a full refund. The customer service for the return and refund was excellent, and I would not hesitate to deal with this company again.

We saw 4 hits come off this album, and I can't believe they didn't release any more.\", ' Not my taste in music: Voice too \"breathy\" to suit my taste. I wouldn\\'t say it is bad; just not the kind of music that I like.', \" Not Much New Here: I did find Cole's analysis of seducing a woman's mind first by helping her clear it useful. Other than that, it's like reading a cheap novel, but without much vulgarity. There are more credible resources.

The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the \"who\" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin\\' much. Disappointing. Won\\'t bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I\\'m a little baffled by all the reviews that say, \"great book, bad ending...\" and still give it 3 stars or more.

Very much enjoyed it. Am looking forward to reading more of her books!', ' Solid album: Most of us lost our virginity with Garbage on their first album, so it is kind of hard to top that one.

Otherwise seemed like a great hitch.\", \" The Gluten-Free Bible: There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer.\", ' Does not work!: It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the.

I got the LP version when the film was first released & still have it. What makes this CD special is the fact that there are alternate selections included that were not part of the original CD release, and that this release was limited to 3,000 copies. I've been enjoying it very much!\", ' This cd is absolutely awesome. Steiner at his best.: I heard they had produced a cd of King Kong. I decided to check it out on the net. I was more than completely satisfied with what I had heard. I plan to purchase the cd and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I brought my young teen-age daughter over to hear it, to my surprise she enjoyed it as well.', ' Sturdy but difficult to install and sticks out too far: This is a very sturdy mount. It is extremely heavy and as other reviewers have noted, it is complicated to setup. The one big drawback is how far out the TV sticks when you have the mount completely pushed in. We wound up buying another mount that sat more flush to the wall. I would recommend a different mount unless you need something this sturdy that can rotate the TV verticle.', ' Very dissapointing for Blu-ray and 3D!: This movie overall was disappointing. I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D. This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased. The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion.', ' sent wrong thing: I chose this rating because I was supposed to be sent both books (combined into one) and the lost boy, but I was only sent a child called it. The book looked nothing like the picture and it was very cleared written that I was supposed to get both. I got jipped.', \" Pretentious bore: Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie.\", ' Amazing...but technology has its drawbacks: I first heard the Belleville Rendez-vous while watching the Academy Awards, and I have hardly stopped listening to this fantastic soundtrack since I got it in the mail yesterday! Jazzy, organic and original it\\'s fun to listen to.But you should note that the CD has some sort of copy control technology on it -- it says in small print \"On some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered\". Well, my Sony stereo -- not entry level, at least according to the money I paid for it! -- doesn\\'t recognize the CD at all, so I can only listen to it using my computer CD player. I\\'m not quite sure what to do about this glitch, and I\\'m not willing to part with the soundtrack, but this aspect of the CD sure is annoying.', \" Compatible ONLY with their software: Bad Scanner.

Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!', \" Middle of the Road: My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it.\", ' Comfortable: We took this bed camping, and it was very comfortable to sleep on. It did lose some air overnight, so we just reinflated before going to bed. Great mattress for the price!', ' From the land of Tellytubbies...: Despite their pretentious, anarchist pose, these guys CAN knock out a blooody goood toon. The title song and the intro to \"Amnesia\" merit special mention but the entire work is strewn with lively and colorful bursts of sound. Give them an \"A\" too for originality and their monster drummer. Less gratifying, but still interesting, are the snippets of dialogue lifted from British television and their mixing of curious psychological and political fantasies. Thumbs down on the silly \"Creepy Crawling\", \"Mary, Mary\" and the obnoxious Jude Abbott.', \" MASK OF FAMILIARITY: MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.\", ' If you like Douglass, you\\'ll like this: Good stuff from the great freedom fighter. Rarely known texts are included with the famous \"Narrative.\" \"The Condition of the Freedmen\", a look at African-Americans 20 years after the end of slavery, provide some sobering thoughts for American Blacks today. \"The Heroic Slave\" tells the little-known true story of Madison Washington, who led a slave ship called \"The Creole\" into freedom in 1841. I would also recommend \"The frederick Doulgass Reader\" and \"The Life and Times of Frederick Doulgass\" to make your \"Dougology\" complete!', \" High Pitched Noise: I read reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound. I figured these reviewers probably had defective adapters. However, mine also makes a high pitched sound. It doesn't do it all the time, but I worry that as it gets older, the sound will get worse. Although it charges my computer fine, if I could do it over again, I might pay the extra money and get a different brand...unless you don't mind high pitched noises.\", ' How pitiful: I consider myself to enjoy a wide variety of movies. When some friends of mine suggested we rent this movie at an outing to Blockbuster Video, I wasn\\'t very excited about it. But \"what the heck, I\\'ll watch anything once.\" First of all, the main character was a bit annying. All the little things she did to help out the bar in an attempt to get back to work with Cyote Ugly made me want to upchuck all over the television. This movie is VERY predictable and a cliche of many others. I\\'m sure many of the younger generation cherish this film and that\\'s about the only audience I think this is going to achieve except cleavage hungry boys.', ' It\\'s Entertainment, Folks: I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word \"Miramax\" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it\\'s just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy...', ' Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!: I just don\\'t get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their \"rock\" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their \"2 Many DJs\" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year\\'s ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album\\'s amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, \"Nite Versions\" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release \"Nite Version\" on 12\" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move.

I might add my daughter is not someone who is easily pleased.\", ' quite bad: I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you\\'re looking for a good book about Caruso take \"My father and my family\" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott.', \" it was okay: I had to read this book for school, and at first I hated it. The beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism, however, it eventually gets better. (slowly) It is easy to miss some concepts if you don't read slowly enough.

Unfortunately, Mr. Keel\\'s tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, \"ufo\" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ...', ' Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain: I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?', \" This book is great, but terrifying.: After I read this book, I was so disturbed that I couldn't concentrate on my homework. Since I could do nothing else, I thought about the book. I realized how lucky we are that we live in a society with privacy, fairness, and freedom. I though it was inhuman when the man in jail (I'm not saying who) was proud of his daughter for turning him in after hearing him mutter in his sleep against the Party. This is the least of the inhuman things that happen. I really am able to apreciate our living in a free society. I hope others can too.\", \" Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot: Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family.

Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4.

I heard a few tracks by accident in a music store. But... we live in dark times, someone singing about friendship and brotherhood makes me feel that there are some good people out there.

This effect is particularly noticeable on \"TOLEDO\".I loved \"Painted From Memory\"- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don\\'t detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g \"Painted from Memory\", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don\\'t add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is \"God Give Me Strength\", which on all other recordings is amazing.', ' Best Cover Album Ever!!: This is a great album with many catchy tunes. Listenable from start to finish and a great primer into SCOTS.', \" A very amusing look at the past: I was hoping for far more details about working and handling sheep in the ways the New Zealander's did in the past when I got this book. Unfortunately, this is a collection of letters from a 'high society' girl that was packed up and moved to the NZ outback with her fiancee.

I think that Joyce's use of language, puns, allusions, and references other pieces of work,completely unlike the Wake, was amazing and better than Lolita, Pale Fire, and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. His main theme is renewal and the fact that history is cyclilic. This is represented by an abundant number of things, such as the fact that he has exactly 1001 characters, and that he has the first and last sentences combine.

The only two things are that I don't like in this matress are that one side of this matress is higher by 2-3 mm than another. And when you sleep on it you feel like there is a small angle. I mean the matress is not 100% horizontal. Another thing that peaces me off is the noise that comes from the matress when you move or somehow turn over.

I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped.

Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the \"monsters\" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die.

She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony.

The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different \"arbor\" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the \"high glaze\" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the \"all blades except the standard have been discontinued\".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future.', \" Not as well-made as I'd hoped: The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else.

The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass.\", ' A padded short story disguised as a literary novel: The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not. Dickens, Poe, even Highsmith have succeeded much better in what Trevor seeks to achieve.', ' Junk plain and simple: great idea the issue is some people (me) dont have the \"flap\" that these fit into on my ear, the top piece needs to be at least 5mm longer to fit without falling out. the teacup ear bud works better.and since i opened it i cant return it way to go amazonif your ears dont have deep folds do not buy these.', ' Still Relevent: Is the book outdated?

Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner. A wonder and deep inspirational experience.\", ' Looks cool but....: This game looked great on the box and that is all I got out of it.Due yourself a favor and check to make sure your system can handle a game of this high speed and graphics.Called the game company waste of time then checked with my computer manufactor another waste of time.If you think you got a old system then stay away from this game unless your looking to waste a day trying to install and it will never happen.', \" A wonderful purchase: This DVD was a great investment.

It was depressing to watch and the story was very poorly written. All of the \"segments\" were left hanging and never actually came together at the end. There was nothing shocking about the ending, it just ended. I had to double check to be sure that was indeed the credits rolling. What a jip, I want my money back.

It passed with flying colors.', \" Where the Cypress Rises: This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it.\", \" ******It Has It All********: Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it.\", \" This book was very good I loved the suspense: there wasn't enough romance though.I wish her books were longer\", ' JUNK: MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE.

Second, the instructions don\\'t describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, \"well... hot water wouldn\\'t do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let\\'s try boiling water - nothing to lose.\"Should be more explicit in the instructions.

He concludes with some of the better known modern rhetoricians. In between these two chapters he traces the history of the field and the various contributors. Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term. Herrick seeks to combine modern example with ancient methodology in some places. Generally speaking this book introduces the subject well. It is clear and comprehensive.

It takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount. Perhaps the blades that crunch the S&P are not sharp enough? Very disappointed in product.', \" Great Record, Bad Remaster: I love this record. And I am also a big fan of remastered re-releases (Bowie, Roxie, etc.), but I was disappointed in the sound of this remaster. My Import version sounds MUCH better...a lot more raw, more vital, better definition between instruments. This sounds like a lot of compression, and not much more.

Würde ihn mir aber niemals auf DVD oder Video kaufen.', ' Run Away, Run: Although \"Run, Lola, Run\" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola\\'s extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The \"driving music beat\" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (\"Lost and Delirious\", \"The Smokers\", \"Black and White\" and \"Armageddon\"). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...\"Run Away, Run\"', ' Right On !: This book is a terrific read!

The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless.

The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning.', \" waste of money: This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user.\", \" Can't Go Wrong With This Item!: I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. As far as the smell, it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies, so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day.

He is constantly getting stuck ( Winnie The Pooh syndrome ), and the other kids generally avoid him. I think the incredible brain trust behind Max Keeble hate fatties. With that said, the rest of the movie was suprisingly realistic and my favorite scene is where the sk8er kid sk8s around the school, because sk8boarding is kewl.Why did they make the popular girl seem like such a jerk?

Unlike those who consider brain research a \"fad\", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students.

I was initially skeptical of watching the same 20 minutes depicted three different ways, but this movie won me over from the beginning. Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.The music, the photography, the editing--everything contributes toward a very fast film experience. After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible. Loads of fun.One of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing--watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first. The interconnection of all the events in the film is much more clear the second time around (though not being as clear the first time doesn't hurt the film in the least).Highly recommended.\", ' The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd: The book I received was a reprint from the collection of the Univesity of Michigan Library \"Prepared by HP\".

I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives.

This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment.\", \" Booooooring: Alright, this movie is boring. I watched it hoping that it would get better and it didn't. I had a lot of high hopes for this movie based on the reviews I read before watching it.

Don't let your kids watch this atrocity.\", \" Umm, I don't know what they were trying to do: This movie is just plain sad. In addition to mediocre acting, the special effects were just as bad. In one scene you could plainly see the safety wire connected to the motorcycle. Bad diologue and senseless nudity made the film even worse. The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J. His on camera presence is always rather captivating to me. It also carried him through a poorly written character. Since most of the movie took place on the track, there was more of the game than I could really put up with. Avoid it.\", \" Lorna Doone - a Classic !: I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!\", \" Perfect background music: I recently heard this tape being played in a shop abroad, and immediately enquired what it was and ordered it from Amazon the moment I returned home. The music is very different and extremely haunting. I have played the tape non-stop and it is perfect background music as it does not disturb ones thoughts at all.

There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible. Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture. This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests.

Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It\\'s just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people\\'s lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people\\'s homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he\\'s in a world of trouble.

I chose this one because from what I read, it was the best deal for the money. Another reason I got it is because you can put WMA files on it. That takes up half the space of MP3's. That's important because I have a lot of music. The software is great. you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories. transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy. even the battery life is great- it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good. only 1 problem, no accessories...yet.

It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. \"Captain Easychord\"), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it\\'s worth the effort.

It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress. I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me.

Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book.\", ' No Disrespect? - How about \"No Clue\": More nonsense about the typical knee jerk, finger pointing, resentment that takes all focus off personal responsibility.

Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea. Even more disturbing: The characters of her main heros (Scarpetta, Marino, Lucie) were described inconsistent with her previous books\", ' A very simple view of a complex subject: Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book.', ' Gripping Film: Very good acting. Very emotional. I empathized with every character!

This is not one of them.: Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in.

For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library.

If you listen to Irish Flute music, you don\\'t need me to tell you who Harry Bradley is. If you\\'ve never heard Irish flute music before, this is a great cd to start with (every Irish flute player has or belongs to a distinctive style; you can try Matt Malloy and Kevin Crawford for others). Look also for Harry\\'s flute duet cd with Michael Clarkson, \"The Pleasures of Hope\"(great stuff) and his other album \"Bad Turns and Horseshoe Bends\" is also excellent. I think you can download an mp3 to see if you like it; I recommend \"Miss Thornton\\'s/The Primrose Lasses\", the third track on the cd which is a great set of tunes that also demonstrate the Belfast/dirty style of playing.', ' A different Charlotte: Charlotte Gainsbourg 5:55 borrows more from \"Air\" than from her father Serge, and is a complete departure from her previous works.

These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include \"Stop, Look, and Listen\" and \"I\\'ll Be Back\".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best.

Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997\"With one of Goethe\\'s most famous lyrics, Mignon\\'s \"Kennst du das Land\", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf\\'s great song was hardly at Spohr\\'s command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency.

This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more.

Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series.

I wrote eforce to compalin (dont bother calling!) and they insisted that all of their products came straight from Motorola!The chargers work fine, so for the price, I got what I paid for.

I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You\\'ll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don\\'t bother.

However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow.

Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you\\'re an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there\\'s much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O.', ' air bed: Great product for my visiting 3 1/2 year old grand daughter!

But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust.\", ' Very fun game: In a lot of ways it does show its age, but most everything about the game is still very fun and pretty addicting.', ' Chemists view of Materials: this book is excellently written for the chemists who are getting into materials science. the cross-over can sometimes be tough due to the \"language barrier\" in that materials typically uses different terms for subjects that chemists use. this book, being written specifically to bridge that gap, does an excellent job presenting the material for the chemists viewpoint.the theory is well laid out and examples of computational approaches and discussion of results are clearly presented. the good and bad of methods are presented in an unbiased way allowing the reader to weigh all options in order to select an approach which is appropriate for their research.i highly recommend this book for any upper level undergraduates of graduate student...or any chemist looking to cross over into the world of materials science.', \" These are not the books you grew up with...: Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me.

Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker.

Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon\", \" The best film nobody saw: The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with.\", \" For anyone who loves great vocals: I cannot speak any french so I have no idea what she's singing about.

Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious.

THE HAUNTING is not that film. What a thankless part for Ms. Lili. What a thankless film. The scariest thing about this movie must have been the bill for the c.g.i. effects that the studio received. I mean, the movie had a moment or two of tension, but on the whole, I was bored.There was nothing new here: the fury of an evil, dead capitalist and the pain inflicted on his mostly children workers--and his family--just can't seem to get out of the house. So! The evil men do does live on! How original! I'm reaching for sarcasm which is never pretty, so I will end here.

I think I might check out the soundtrack though.', ' Good choice for getting a vintage look: I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try.', ' excelent product!: This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back. I love it! Is my second buy.

High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come.\", ' go with the view: I was upgrading from a Sandisk Sansa e280 4GB unit.

The front speakers and center channel were OK. The rear was terrible. The overall audio quality was the worst I have heard. Listened to it once and went back the next day thinking my set up had to be wrong. Tried two other DVD's and both were fine.

You won't go wrong with this one.\", ' very small and lasted about 1 hour: I was really excited about this toy. Unfortunately, it was very small and lasted maybe 2 hours before breaking. Excessively cheap construction. Worth it only if you find it in the dollar store (toy was maybe 6-8 in nose to tail)', \" Kyra's Story: This series is about the guilt three different people feel involving the death of Sammy, who is a twin brother to Kyra. This book is Kyra's point of view. This series is interesting because there are three different points of view and you get to see how each person tells the story. This book was absolutely amazing! Everything in this book was so real, I could actually see something like that happening in my town and in my highschool. Everyone can relate to something in the book, maybe even more than one thing. I could not put it down and found myself staying up late just to get further into the book! I can't wait to read the next book, Miranda's story. I would recommend this book to all teen girls out there or anyone else looking for a great read! You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't!\", ' Too melodramatic: This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize.', \" THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ: ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ!

The pleasure of Shirley Jackson's novel is its graceful understatement and its exacting psychological examination of fear. The film has neither of these virtures.

That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley\\'s \"A Brave New World\" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. \"Island\" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone.', \" fun when it works: This is definitially not as fun as the original 1990 one with removable teeth, and its lungeing motion. This version is smaller than a softball. I really expected it to be the size of the gator golf like mine was growing up.the flaw im finding in this is with the spring they use to make it shut. often the mouth only shuts half way, or and sometime syou have to open and shut the mouth 3+ times to get all the teeth up. Now it worked perfect for about 15 min. My daughter is 3, and she has already gotten annoyed with it becuase of the number of times weve played it and known it was supseod to bite us, but it didnt. I have ordered the original one off ebay since its no longer avaliable new, but will keep this as its a good solution for the car when watching dvd's get boreing.\", \" Brief but Useful Introduction: I've used this book in the undergraduate Romanticism courses I teach, and found it quite useful. It is brief, brisk, and cleanly written, and serves as a good introduction to Byron. You won't find a lot of subtle insights into Byron's more obscure works here, but you will see how the life and the work converge and, at times, diverge. If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you. If you want geat detail and a full, scholarly treatment, you'll have to go elsewhere, though. Peters isn't catering to those needs.\", ' Outdated, Innacurate, Self-agrandizing: Watch the Movie: I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi\\'s egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his \"Helter Skelter\" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE\\'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case.', \" Please make a reprint of this book.: For me, Steampunk started with this book. It brought to me the beauty and anachronisms of the Victorian culture mixed with the surprises and action of modern sci/fi. My wife, who loves vampire stories probably even more than I do, had never read the book and when I went about trying to find a copy of it for her, it seemed impossible. Thank god for the internet (and to a lesser extent, Amazon). I was finally able to get a used hardback for a sum that wasn't too insulting. My wife tore through it and loved the weirdness as much as I do. It is crazy that this book has not had a recent reprint.

I love this book very much and reread it immediately. This soft cover volume is easier for my elderly fingers to handle while reading. This is a series that will never grow old and one that I will pass on to my grandchildren in the future.\", \" Horrible Movie!!!: I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. The main character, Diane Lane, annoyed me. Plus, the storyline was depressing. Nothing ever went right in her life. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless.\", ' The best so far: Great popcorn flick. Big difference between the dvd & bluray.

If you aren't expect to pay at least $40 for the clowns at Creative to fix it. If you think I am just flaming them, check out their forums.\", \" The book is very boring and in some parts,doesn't make sense: This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read.

I understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version and released that instead. Because of this irritating and pointless feature of an otherwise fine movie (the best of the Mad Max series), I can only rate the dvd 2 stars.', \" Hardy's Dead, but he's still alive in Writing: A compeling and creepy classical fiction to read. It felt like I was doing something wrong by reading Tess, even though I did not have a reason to believe why. But the bottom line's that, from the first chapter until the last, you'll feel as if there's someone standing behind you, ready to hurt you. Your spirit feels free, that's what Thomas Hardy can do to you as a person.\", ' Not Enough Choices: There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.', \" delightful and quirky: I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Anyone who has ever undergone a painful divorce will relate to this movie. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I did not feel that Lane's acting was overdone. The angst of betrayal and divorce is just that, angst.The movie also had its delightfully quirky moments and while it was heavily salted and peppered with typical love story fare, it was also full of marvelous insights.Life marches on and there are opportunities at every turn.\", \" Not one change: I have been taking two capsules daily for two months and not felt or seen one difference in my health. This hasn't been the miracle pill to help cure my PCOS or help my ovulate. In fact, I had a period before I started this pill and not one since.\", \" Conceited book: Had to offset the praise handed down by so many people for Karourac's writings. Very overrated as a writer. This book is filled with the resemblance of substance, but has nothing in it. It is a contradiction of itself.\", \" Good but disappointed: I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed. I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective.

Danna Korn's books (Wheat-free, Worry-free and Kids with Celiac) are very factual and well researched. Tania Pineo\", \" Tha Dogg Pound: This album absolutely sucked. They are still living off of Dr. Dre's scraps from '94. Seriously ever since Snoop sold out and became some wanna be 1970's style pimp, he has dropped off the map as far as importance to the rap game. Kurupt and Daz still have a little bit in the tank, but not enough to warrant buying this album. Anyone who says this album is good is only kidding themselves.

Very different too.', \" A moving book about the endurance of humanity: I first read this book when I was in 7th grade, and am rereading it now, in 11th grade. This is an amazing story that my dad convinced me to read, and I've become hooked on the whole series! Auel gives the reader not only meticulously researced information concerning culture, vivid descriptions of the neanderthals, and geography, but also a twisting, inviting plot that makes the book impossible to put down! Thus Clan of the Cave Bear(and the entire Earth's ChildrenTM series) appeals to a wide audience. Adventure, history, and an eloquent storytelling style are combined with excellent results.\", ' A complete literacy masterpiece!: A complete literacy masterpiece! I had been meaning to read 100 years of solitude for over 7 years but never found the time to do so until now and the book did not disappoint! Gabriel Garcia Marquez painted a whole society with his beautiful breathtaking descriptions of the town Mocondo. I loved the characters from the Buendia family and other fond myself laughing and other times pausing to contemplate his points on life through the actions of some of the characters. There is a little of everything for everyone in this book! Highly recommended!', \" An Unfound Gem: This band has a straight forward approach to music that is sturdy, simple, aggressive and a little annoying, in a good way. The often frenetic lead guitar is right up front to create a classic rustic American sound. This band must like Blind Willie McTell as they cover Dying Crapshooters Blues and mention Mctell in their original track Down at Danny's. If you are looking for something different with a classic American roots music sound - this is a nice find.\", ' Looks good on blu-ray: Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody.

Not suitable for children, period!', \" Overrated book: I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that?

But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids.\", ' A Must Read!: Enter one very unlikely hero who is trying to call national attention to the scourge.

It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design.

The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller.

The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest\\'s vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest\\'s singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It\\'s NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album.

The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe\\'s youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he\\'s sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe\\'s ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you\\'d want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover.', ' Upsetting: I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture.

Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood.\", ' Neanderthal Sexists: This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. I giggled every time one of the Neaderthal characters \"made the sign\" indicating the command for sexual favors, picturing the short rhythmic fist pumping motion sometimes used by modern males to allude to intercourse.

I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover.

The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes.\", ' Great Stuff: Second only to Dashiell Hammett, the works of Raymond Chandler are the best in American crime fiction.

It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house.\", \" How else would you like to WASTE MY TIME?: To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves.

Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese.\", ' amazing!: i loved this book! its undoubtedly a must read!! i need a sequel! im going to be forcing the library fo get this! it definitely deserves these 5 stars!', ' The Scarlet Letter e-Book: Great book, had seen the movie but the book is much more.

To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told.\", ' Terrible movie with good special effects: The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones.

What am I missing here?', ' Quick, interesting, and accurate: This is different from the \"Asian Saga\" books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point. Clavell was in a POW camp so I get the sense that it is accurate, that it lauds real people through their character portrayals (indirectly), and it scathes other people in the same way.', ' outstanding: I first read this book 30 years ago and I was certain that it explained much in American politics at that time. As I read it today, I see that it still explains much of American politics, but, it also explains much of politics of nations throughout the world and is fully consistent with much of the more cynical writings of political philosophy over the years, such as Machievelli. This is a fantastic story that is VERY easy to read, get involved in, relate to the main character, and find oneself caught in the truth of versus the appearance of reality. Excellent!!! A+', ' A Scientific Saga: I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate. I would call this book a scientific saga.', ' the other reviewer is right: Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the sound on this album and it\\'s so bad that it makes this album unacceptable and a waste of your money. What a shame! Although I can clearly tell there was nothing wrong with Eddie Fisher\\'s performance of this set of songs; the sound quality (and probably the mastering) of these tracks is every bit as poor as the other reviewer states that it is.Therefore, I would recommend one of two alternatives. Diehard Eddie Fisher fans will probably want both! First, there is the very good (even though it\\'s currently out of print) CD entitled \"Songs for Christmas\" by Eddie Fisher which has two bonus tracks by Frankie Laine. Second, there is the CD that contains the music from three of Eddie\\'s record albums entitled \"Eddie Fisher Sings;\" \"I\\'m in the Mood for Love\" and \"Christmas with Eddie Fisher.\" In short, you\\'ll be much better off with one or even both of these two other albums.', \" One of the best albums ever made.

I do love this album from Motorhead though.', ' Memoir or Memory?: Although Derrida can be difficult to follow sometimes, this work is extremely intriguing and thought provoking. Well illustrated as well, as should be expected considering it was the catalogue for an exhibition.', \" A Dream Version of La Traviata: This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.\", \" Transformers: Well, I didn't think the series would get worse , but it did.This movie is not only bad , I wouldn't buy this on DVD, Blu Ray , or on bootleg.This is as bad as it gets for action movies .

It is not a scholarly book. The note in the back of the book mentions a few sources, but there are no direct citations for most of their \"godless\" assertions in the text of the book. Thus, the authors take huge liberties with their assertions. They ignore blaring facts such as over half of the signers of the Constitution had degrees in divinity.', \" How does Hilton do it? Magic? I can't figure out why his books are so moving.: Not Hilton's best, but still somehow a gem.An aimless Englishman poses as a peasant in Revolutionary Russia, & subsequently tries to wander his way back to Western Europe, discovering on the way something more important: a reason to live--but too late?Despite these problems:1) the plot, as the travelers, wander terribly,2) the supporting characters are usually either stock or flat,3) the 'suspense' usually fails, as event turns are often predictable,4) slow start; unsatisfying ending.the story still somehow works, and works well!I just don't get it. Hilton violates cardinal rules of a good novel and still somehow turns out a work that wrenches my frozen heart.Must be something in the manner of the telling.If you like this story, you'll love Hilton'sRandom Harvest, or his more famousLost Horizon: A Novel(BTW, in both cases, avoid the movies --terrible, terrible flops!)\", ' \"A World Within a World\": \"A World Within a World\" says it all. This is probably the best CD I own. I absolutly LOVE silverchair, I have been a fan since they first came out with \"Tomorrow\". This CD just proves how diverse and talented they are. Daniel Johns (lead singer) has such a beautiful and magestic voice.It definitely makes all troubles go away by just listening to it. It is soooo great to hear these bright and happy lyrics. I am looking forward to hearing much more from them.', \" A great edition!: I love the Cambridge School series of Shakespeare's plays because of the way it helps you along as you read. Not only does it explain the language, but it explains the Elizabethan puns and points out things that you would have never noticed. I recommend this book to everyone, especially teachers for their classes.\", ' very simple interpretation of bellydance: I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several.', ' Reasonable prep for chldbirth: I bought this to prep myself and my husband for the natural (midwife attended) birth of our second child. It is a reasonable video and keeps you fairly entertained. However I do not agree with everything that is \"taught\" on this video; I guess that\\'s why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt. Birthing on your back in a hospital is NOT the best or least traumatic way to bring a new baby into the world! Good luck!!', ' Do not read this book!: It has been a while since I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. In particular, I did not like how the 2nd Zina was treated.', \" Great job on this one: I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth. The actors did a great job, but there were too many gaps in the story. This, however, was a really, really good film. It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one. The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.It wasn't perfect, however.People vanishing from an altered timeline... That just doesn't happen. There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch. You don't destroy things in the parallel universes. It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific. If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers. Great job by everyone.Sci-fi Channel, Please make more!Everyone else, Please buy this so they will!\", \" Returned it: This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books.

Great pictures really make the book user friendly. Would make a great gift.', \" reads like a novel: ...because it is a novel. Kingsley started going off the deep end with this one, but as long as you remind yourself that this is just a story he is telling, a story from within him that actually has very little to do with Plato and Parmenides but only one guy's vision of them as characters in a book, it is actually a charming little thing to read. It may be literature and it may be mysticism but philosophy it ain't.\", ' Vocabulary Extender: Boring, poorly set up, no dynamic or real plan to sit down X number of hours a day and cover Y amount of material so you can become exponentially more glib.

That stuff is out there, these clips are teasers. In fact, I own some old FM concert VHS tapes which I purchased when new (Tusk documentary, Mirage tour, etc). I look at the vaults on The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac cd and wonder why not DVD? Frustrating, they would look and sound great. Still, I never saw the Rumours photo session footage which is included on this DVD and that was an unexpected treat even if it was too short. I knew at the time of Rumours release that there was a lot of turmoil going on in the band but had no idea to what extent until I watched these interviews. All's well now apparently since they have a new cd due out in April. I sure will miss Christine, though. I recommend this DVD to any old diehard Fleetwood Mac fans who crave anything from those good old days and also to the new ones so that you can learn about their history.\", ' Looking For Similar to Better Shower Companion: Best Part? Nice Girth (unusual for a rabbit). Worst? Length. I find it too short.

It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I\\'d like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer.', \" The Worst Movie Ever!: This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!\", ' Simply brilliant!: This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff\\'s \"Crashproof\" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard\\'s The Great Depression.', \" This is really something special....: I've been studying music in the classical realm for a long time, but have always been interested in electronic music in both performance and composition. Of all the electronic I've heard from Kraftwerk to Daft Punk, I must say this is perhaps the best I have ever heard. This two-disc set is nothing less than magnificent. The formal structure and sheer smoothness of the sounds from minute 1 to 95 is how music SHOULD be heard in the preset day. I have played every Beethoven Sonata, the complete Etudes of Chopin, Islamey, Gaspard de la Nuit, on and on... As an experienced pianist and professional classical musician, I think I can safely say that these master composers would have GLADLY accepted Hawtin into their inner circle, if not for the plethora of distinct, yet related sounds, then for the complexity of the underlying formal structure that holds the entire soundscape together. This is a modern master-work. Don't miss the chance to experience it...\", ' A Taste of Italy: Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion?

It's more like - zoo animals.It has a good, thick amount of insulation and is free of harmful plastics, etc. It's also a lot roomier than your average lunchbox and I like this because it leaves extra room for more freezer blocks to keep everything very cold. We also send two drinks, one for lunch and one for snacktime and the extra room is great!I agree with others about this being difficult to clean, so we send a paper plate and have the little one eat outside of the lunchbox, so we don't wind up with crumbs, etc inside the interior seams, problem solved.It's also nice to have a lunchbox that not every kid has, so he knows which one is his. This will probably last the entire school year and that's good for a fabric lunchbox.

It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time.\", \" Dont order them in white or any light color: We have owed these plates in white for quite some years. maybe six or more. I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable.

The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said \"XY\" while it should have been \"XX\". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests. If you dont plan on doing sample tests then this book might be for you.', \" Worst Movie EVER!: Horrible Movie, worst I have ever seen!

It centers around the five amateur models on the shortlist to replace supermodel Swan for a cosmetics campaign. There are so many things going on in this book that it never has time to get boring!

I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her).\", \" I was very disappointed with this book.: This book doesn't even come close to the quality I have come to expect from Maeve Binchy. The story lines never come together. Basically, the entire book is a set of character sketches. Yes, it kept my attention and I did finish the book, but by the time I was finished, I regretted spending the time on it and fussed at my mother who told me in advance that this was not one of her favorites. (She should have been a bit more forthcoming!) I would not recommend this book; on the contrary, I would discourage someone from investing any time on this book. There are many, many better books out there, including all others by still-a-favorite Maeve Binchy.\", \" This is a great tool to help you winterize your RV: I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer. Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure. That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex. This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again.\", \" Great Game: My daughter, almost 7, loves this game.

Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic.

Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong.

I did not really know to much about him, even being a big American League baseball fan.It is amazing to read some of the stories how he was difficult, may not have said things the way he should have, and how he was not always a good player, well little mistakes. But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.Mike', \" doesn't live up to expectations: Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back.\", \" What a Cryin' Shame ....: I love Tina. Her music is the epitome of energizing soul-rock. We looked forward to this DTS version of her concert. We put it in, sat back, and after 5 minutes into the concert I was becoming agitated at what should be a great show. The music was great, but after 30 minutes I was going nuts. Then it dawned on me: the camera work is absolutely the worst. It's horrible. It detracts from the concert. It never stops moving. It never stops fading in & out. It jumps from one angle to another. It changes every few seconds and it never stops for the whole concert. A bunch of high school kids could have done better.

However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them \"Trilogy\".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box.

I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one.', \" Excellent signal: A few points I'd like to share:1. Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal. I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option.

Full of wonderful special effects, gorgeous Mediterranean vistas, and gods and goddesses who look their parts, this movie is still driven by personalities. The casting was brilliant: Armand Asante is all that one could wish in an Odysseus -- engaging, passionate, mature, heroic in every dimension. Isabella Rosellini and Greta Saachi are perfect in their roles as Athena and Penelope, respectively. Telemachus is a classical adolescent only child, and Antichea, Odysseus's mother, dominates each of her scenes. While this production is eye-candy from beginning to end, the visual appeal cannot distract from the timeless humanity of its characters. There is a reason that Homer's story still reaches us after 3000 years, and this telling does justice to its ancient material.\", ' whoa: Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days.

The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great.\", ' Beautifully Done: The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words.', ' Blue Eyes Shining Dragon: I do own this toy, and is a huge fan of the film, so this toy for me is very nice. It may not be very durable, or does much, or may not look like the reall thing very much, but that is why you can still pretend with it. The toy itself lights up and makes noises. Also, when you press a button on its back, its wings and legs spread out, so like the Duel Disk Launcher, it could hurt a real little kid, but not kids who know what it does. I still have fun with the toy, plus it doubles as a model for those out there who like the model Yu-Gi-Oh! products.

I have turned into an \"Armchair Everest Junkie\". Lene\\'s perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!', \" Swagman Bike Rack: Very well made and solid (heavy).

Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire. Don't waste your money, this is an awful record.\", ' A Feast for the Eyes and Ears: Jean de Florette is a beautifully made motion picture. This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film. Yves Montand is superb as the aging, greedy Cesar Soubeyran. Gerard Depardieu is never better than in the title role as the hopeful and yet tragic hunchback hero. The English sub-titles in no way detract from this cinematographical delight.', \" Great Value for the Money: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm.

The pump for the rocket is made so you have to hold it while pumping but there is no good way to hold it securely while pumping.

The piston in the pump is so cheap that it bends when you push it in. The end cap on the pump chamber is not properly secured to the pump. I tried the pumps that came with both rockets. The rocket's highest flight was about 10 feet becuase the pumps were so lame.\", ' Alternate History meets Classic Horror: Kim Newman\\'s gothic horror novel, \"Anno Dracula\" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker\\'s original masterpiece. Newman asks the reader a simple question: What if Dracula had won in his confrontation with van Helsing and the other protagonists from Stoker\\'s novel? His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks. If you liked Dracula and don\\'t mind the occasional \"What If\" scenario then you might want grab a copy of this hard to find gem.', \" SANSA Sandisk 8 gb: I've had this product about 3 years now and use it everyday.

Though she sought to understand the Amish way of life, she totally missed what it is all about. Maybe it was because the church service was in German or maybe she was so focused on herself that she could not see beyond to the fact that peace comes from a relationship with God. Her final line in the book stated that miracles take a lot of work. I would beg to disagree and say that God is the one who does miracles and therefore they take no work, just faith. This is what Sue Bender missed and is still missing I am afraid. We use Amish textbooks in our home education program, so the insights she shared were not really new to me. I think her description of the Amish is valid, but her understanding is lacking. I would not particularly recommend this book.', ' Well Done Aerial Combat Sequences, Little Else: This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting.What a lame excuse for a movie. My biggest complaint of this movie is that it\\'s so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim\\'s face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don\\'t buy this turkey.

I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny.

Bilingual adventures in Spanish and English you won't soon forget. Great for children of all ages!\", \" Unbelievable: This is a politically-correct Broadway play set to film. It fails utterly. Guinness is badly miscast, looking about as Japanese as, say, Robert Morley. Rosalind Russell is barely plausible as a Jewish mother. The movie lacks wit, humor, sophistication, action, and suspense. It's basically a soap opera with lots of preaching about the brotherhood of man (oops, humankind). It's no surprise to me that the film has not been released on DVD. No one needs to waste time like that. Put this one in your Turkey book.\", ' Kind of lame, as most horror movies are: I\\'m not usually one for horror movies, but a friend of mine made me watch \"The Descent\" with her, and it wasn\\'t as awful as I thought it would be. The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you\\'re a fan of horror films, you\\'ll probably enjoy \"The Descent\" because it\\'s gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you\\'re like me and don\\'t care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one.', ' BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL: As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Everest, I found this book to be nothing more than self-indulgent \"New Age\" drivel. Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I\\'m happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I\\'ve yet to read!', \" Genius? Puh-lease! It's self gratifying garbage: I generally like Nick Cage even in his bad movies. This bad movie leaves very little to like about Nick or Herzog.

He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing.\", \" Poor quality: I purchased this item to wear postpartum. I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby. The major downside to this is the poor quality. The eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely. I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest. Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others, to instead be a waste of my money!\", \" Worth the effort: I have read this book twice now, once in high school and now again in my 50's. it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written. It was difficult read but the more I got into the book, the easier it became. The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving. I plan to read it again in my 80's and I know I will see it in a completely different light. I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes.\", ' Older Craftsman Garage Door Opener.: I have an older Craftsman Garage Door Opener. Had replaced the gears to my garage door opener and it would not work right. Would only move a foot or so and stop.

Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalbá evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure.\", ' Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage.: The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong.

Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!).

We both found her to actually be humorous in most parts. This dvd is very easy to understand and is great, especially for new parents like us.

But it\\'s dvd by mail only, not instant streaming.', \" Very Tiny Stamp Set: I didn't read the specs very well and didn't see just how tiny this set is. While it is very nice, it is very tiny. The stamps themselves are rather small. My guess is that I could've gotten single stamps at a craft store for a bit less. However, it does come in a nice storage box and my son loves using them. Overall, I think they are well made and I would purchase again.\", \" Dark Side of the Moon: I'm a huge fan of Transformers - couldn't wait for this to come out on blu-ray so I could see all the captivating colors of the autobots - as only blu-ray can!

Still, if you are a fan as I am, it's a must have to make the collection complete.\", \" It was like a bad dream, but I couldn't wake up: This book is like a bad soap. No action. No drama. Very predictable. It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man. The baby dad is the preacher. Why the couple couldn't have gotten a divorce is beyond me. And the writing is horrible. Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it. Reading this is like a punch in the testicles.. it HURT!!! This book is hell on earth. Don't read it. By the way, I had to give it one star.\", \" A somewhat annoying companion: This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in.\", \" Good songs, but I have heard them all already: The Dissapointed.

Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video.\", \" They should have stayed in the fourth.: I was attracted to this movie by the stars. I have not read the book, but I view movies on the basis of a perceived entertainment value. Unfortunately, this one is not very entertaining, nor is it very believable, even as a so-called psychological drama. It's the first time I've ever been disappointed by Kristen Scott Thomas.

To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy\", ' Should be Free with purchase of Belkin OmniView.

Doubtful...more like an individual who proves how influential environment is on forming of human character. If you read this book and don't in some small way sympathize with the human being that is Charles Manson then you're less human than the 'monster' he is purported to be. Inevitably there is bias and self indulgent perspectives conveyed here; the writing is relatively average as well though it flows smoothly & does compel one to turn the page, even with droopy eyelids. At least it is an answer to the best seller written by the man who was most instrumental in putting Manson behind bars; at most it's as close to a confession the literary world will probably ever see from Mr. Manson.\", ' Purchased twice-never worked: My 4 year old used his piggy bank money to purchas this toy. We could not get the mouth to chomp down no matter how many teeth we pushed in any order. We returned it for a new one from a different seller& had the same problem.

Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock\\'s Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an \"ambient\" percussion section that makes you want to say \"laswell is a genius.\" This is followed by an \"afro-pop\" song/rap that makes you want to say \"why does Laswell have to mess with everything.\" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the \"smooth jazz\" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah\\'s best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes.', \" war of the warewolf: Greenberg and Tuccille have written an old fachoned lycanthropic thriller with some amusing political undertones.

The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly.

With the remastered deluxe edition the color is great.', ' A novel about fireman who are paid to set books ablaze: This book was very interesting to read.

The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great.

Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about.\", ' Chilling tale of anti-utopian England: I won\\'t say that Orwell was ahead of his time, because 1984 came and went without any domineering governments popping up, but this is still a brilliant book. It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve \"the Party\" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples\\' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature.', \" Plenty of action: This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth.\", \" Worst game I have ever played: Wow. Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever.\", ' I like this book!: I like the book Castle In the Attic because it was very adventurous. My favorite part in the book was when Mrs.Philips gave William a gift. Do you know what the gift was? Can you figure out what it is? I recommend this book because Castle In the Attic is a very exciting novel to read.', ' Awful: I\\'ll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word \"Classic\" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was \"meaty\" (whatever that is), \"deep\", and \"powerful\"; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle.', \" Junk: Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not.\", ' Please!: This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn\\'t need special effects to be scary. I saw \"The Sixth Sense\" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don\\'t waste your money.', \" AMAZING series: I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal. Each book has spun a world of reality-based fantasy which can guide how we see the world today. The world of Ayla, the Clan, and the Others is one in which EVERYONE should enter... and decide to stay.\", ' Received a different book: I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received.', ' Simple but Perfect: \"Fahrenheit 451\" is one of those rare books that goes straight to the heart of its issue, what we are doing to ourselves in this TV/Multimedia crazed society. So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence.', ' THE book on this unique style: If you are researching illumination of Spanish Codex and manuscripts this is the book to have. There are only two books written in English that cover this unique style; the other book on Spanish medieval illumination is:Early Spanish Manuscript Illumination. The quantity and quality of the pictures in \"The Illuminated Manuscripts...\" make the price worth it. Spanish 10-11th century illumination is quite separate and unique from the rest of Europe using lively imagery, repeating patterns and vivid color combinations. This book captures the spirit of Spanish medieval artwork and shows the world the finest examples of this form.', \" The best eye gel I've ever used!!: I have been using this eye gel for a few years now and while I am approaching 50, my eyes sure don't look it!\", ' Charlie Brown delights as always: The new blu ray version of A Charlie Brown Christmas is excellent.

My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo.

It does not even contain the \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing.', \" I wish it were a better book: In the book, author Bernstein notes that he writes 5 books a year. It shows. His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family. Many of them say interesting things, but without a persistent interviewer to ask the follow-up questions, few of the anecdotes yield much new insight.\", ' TOO HOT TO TOUCH!: THIS CONCERT WAS SO HOT.

Apparently they no longer repaired that model, and sent me a Firewire instead.First, the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions, so this is kind of disturbing.Second, the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack, so if you load the pack, whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back, and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight, rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket, and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed.\", \" Zzzzzzzzzz.....: TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck.\", ' A poster?

She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her.

Handclaps and half rhythms are only one tenth of the awkwardness on this record. I dont think that anyone with fully functioning ears would like this record, unless they think it makes them look different. For the most part, there is nothing innovative on this record.

You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story.

This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs.\", ' Very good DVD, better than watching Barney reruns over and over.: The video is very good, it is cartoon characters which really kept my 5 year old engaged. I think the information is a little bit complex, but in my case that is a good thing because I dont want him to master the DVD the first time he watches it. I think it is great for what it is, I only wish they had a larger series covering more about the subject. I will have to say the materials on the DVD are very catchy, and my son loves watching it.

On the box it says over 3 hours of tracks, but none of the CDs lasts over an hour. That, and the fact that it appears like it was made by some amateur over the Web with various soundbytes snipped together (I'm exaggerating) are my biggest complaints.Only some of the tracks are even worth listening to. At first I found the dialogue somewhat fascinating, but it quickly faded into trite without much replay value.

Amazon listed it out of stock, but I managed to find a copy. I am amazed to see months later that you still show it out of stock. It is an excellent DVD. I particularly liked the way Ms Woods demonstrated each technique on paper rather than describing it, all the time showing the model, and at times even superimposing her drawing over the model to make a point. I found many of her 'lessons' helpful and would think many Amazon clients would agree. Incidentally, her book that piqued my interest wasLife Drawing: A Journey to Self-Expression\", \" Dismal: I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems.

Honestly, we both found this woman-Ms. Bayles- to be extremely annoying with her stories and condescending atttude. She constantly made fun of the people she was talking about...especially the men. We were expecting a nice take it easy approach to lamaze, but we found ourselves rolling our eyes at every digression.

The story is great, the graphics are much better then previous Tomb Raider releases but the controls ruined the game for me. One would think with all the 1st person shooters with very precise and smooth controls Tomb Raider would have them too, not so.

Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected.\", \" Good Witchy Fun!: This is one of my favorites in the Night World series by LJ Smith. I have a thing for witches, and all the information about actual spells, spell ingredients, circle casting, and witch history was simply fascinating. Thea is a great character, and her relationship with her soulmate Eric is endearing, but the real standout star in this book is Blaise.Blaise seems like your typical wicked witch, but despite her disdain for humans (that's how she was raised so you can't really blame her), she's supremely loyal to her family. What she does in the end for Thea almost made me cry.What I love about LJ Smith's books is that the main themes go much deeper than just supernatural characters; her books explore and highlight the importance of relationships, love and loyalty.

Author Hilary Hart offers intimate and really moving encounters with eight contemporary and mostly hidden mystics from different backgrounds, like Buddhism, and Sufism.

I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from \"Billy Madison\" to \"Punch-Drunk Love\". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for \"Eight Crazy Nights\". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler\\'s Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don\\'t, you\\'ll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces.

A brilliant if somewhat bitter character, who has spent a major portion of his life fighting Indians and is therefore much more aware of the danger of fighting them as if they were civilized soldiers who obey the tactics of war.Henry Ford, as usual does an incredible acting job, as the ignorant Colonel Owen Thursday, who's pride gets him into much more trouble then it's worthI can't say that I actually ever rooted for the Indians (who did a wonderful job of appearing uncivilized) which I suppose is how it's supposed to be :-) And I was highly disappointed that Owen never made it back.

I suggest any fan of acid rock/heavy psych, hard rock, classic rock, blues rock, or early heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath get this album today.\", ' One of my all-time favorites: This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut. The singles that attracted me were \"I Think I\\'m Paranoid\" and most of all the sparkling \"Special.\" This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you\\'re getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. I remember that I got tired of songs like \"Hammering in My Head\" on the first listen, but now it\\'s my favorite. The best thing about this album, though, is it\\'s emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. The best example is You Look So Fine -- absolutely haunting. Of course it probably has a lot to do with the time of my life when I discovered this CD, but it\\'s made an impact on me that will stay with me forever.', ' Awesome Costume: This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes.', \" Dry Sci-Fi: I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this.\", ' Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars: This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don\\'t know who wrote up the \"publisher\\'s review\", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That\\'s it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me.', \" The album divine: This album is the best of Yello's earliest albums. My favourite song is Si Senor The Hairy Grill, but Call It Love is also good as well as Goldrush, Dr Van Steiner, The Rythm Divine and L'Hotel.

Buy this album!\", ' Don\\'t Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie: The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie\\'s performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan\\'s 1965 British tour in \"Don\\'t Look Back\" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin\\'s \"The Song Remains the Same,\" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace.', \" Dated screed: I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic.\", \" unfinishable: A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably.\", \" Only Windows XP and earlier Support: This scanner works great but if you want to update the unit or use their printing software you can only run their drivers on a Windows XP machine or earlier. Windows XP is over 10 years old. You can't load the data from the scanner into your computer if you have Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. They seem to have no plan to update their system for this scanner or any of the EZ Scan line.Keep in mind Microsoft is dropping support for Windows XP in spring of 2014, a little more than a year away. Why don't they have something that works with more current computers especially when you can only buy one with Windows 7 or mostly now with Windows 8.In addition, for most of their models the firmware is 4.07 and I believe the 07 stands for 2007 as that's as current as the unit shows for cars.

Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!', ' Why, oh why, oh why!: Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. It is an awful thing (cant bring myself to call it a film) with shoddy acting horrendous set design and one of the most fake, boring scripts ever.

The movie \"The Scarlet Letter\" has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it.

However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn\\'t see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal \"mind meld\" is one of the most ridiculous things I\\'ve ever read.

DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice.

However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you\\'re introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they\\'re having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there\\'s teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It\\'s just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of \"If it feels good, do it.\" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids.', \" What a great experiment!: The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah! My favorite is their interpretation of that jukebox favorite, Crazy.

Within a couple of days after receiving my pillow my hoarseness was gone! Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow. My doctor said the back roll is to help keep one from sliding down the pillow.

It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book.

Also, the glowing ring would indicate that it IS charging -- sometimes the other end of the electrical plug will come loose, and I wouldn't be aware that the computer isn't charging if it wasn't for the light.

This movie was laughingly bad - particularly if you've seen the timeless and still very scary original. Once again Hollywood chooses FX over everything else (plot, character development, etc.). If you are the kind of person who needs to be spoon fed your entertainment - having everything explained to you every step of the way and can't believe in it if you don't see it, you will certainly enjoy this video.

The whole motorcycle chase thing to the border was unnecessary and seemed wedged into the movie; kinda unnatural. And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird. I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened. The action sequences were ok, but considering what the plot was, it seemed overly dramatic.

However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here.\", \" THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!: As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey!

It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes).

I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth?

There, I\\'ve shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye.', \" Thought-provoking and at times chilling: Many have heard allusions to Big Brother through television or movies. Many have heard that they should read this book because it's a classic, or because of the amazing predictions from 1949 about life in the future. Everyone should read this book.If you read it hoping to find action, or hoping to find a tie to the world as we know it, you most likely won't comprehend the actual meaning of the words. You'll be most successful if you consider what we have today compared to what we had when Orwell wrote the book in 1949. Think of how much the world has changed, and how far there is left to go.Read this book, and every chapter think of the relationship to everyday life. This isn't a book that should be skimmed. Think of the implications of Orwell's predictions. Realize that it could happen.Is it a novel, or is it possible? Are we starting to live in Orwell's world?\", \" An amazing follow-up...: I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better.\", \" Underground classic: This is a complex, slow, mesmerizing film. Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film.\", ' Excellent postcards!: These are wonderful postcards for any dog and/or animal lover. The photos are very well-done and the dogs are adorable.As the previous reviewer stated, the postcards are black and white pictures of dogs with a short bit of information on the back including the photographer, title and date of the photograph and a short bit of information on the dog in the photo.They are printed on thick 6\" x 6\" cardstock, which will make them durable in the mail (if you intend to mail them).

It is a wonderful wonderful toy that my developmentally delayed preschooler and his typical friend all LOVE. But I carry it to the park in a large toy bag and the past two copies have broken...when you press a tooth it won't stay down anymore. A good way around this might be to keep it in a box of it's own.This is also a wonderful toy for parents following the RDI Steve Gutstein social therapy for children with Autism. Because this toy has an element of surprise, as you press each tooth you never know if this is the tooth that will cause the jaw to snap shut! Note: the snapping shut is fairly gentle and safe for preschoolers!\", ' Length makes the \"lightness\" feel heavy: Based faithfully on the book by Milan Kundera, a non-political Lothario doctor in Prague in 1968 comes to grips with two things in his life: his love for one woman and a commitment to the political uprising in his homeland. Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm. Because of this the movie as a whole seems to lack focus. But this is compensated for in the story\\'s interest. The sex scenes are very sensual. Worth a watch.', \" huh?: I just don't get it?

However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers.

It did drone on at some points (medical interventions/medications/cord blood banking).

Yes, it is a \"reimaging\" of the original film and the plot differs a bit from that film. So what? That is what reimaging is all about.I\\'m also interested in paranormal phenomena and how they are depicted in films. The original film was scary because of the sound effects. There are also sound effects in this version AND now we get to see the spirits of the children and the evil Hugh Crane. CGI makes this possible as we see ghostly children outlined in curtains, weird morphed reflections, and a Hill House that literally comes alive and undergoes threatening distortions.I\\'ve watched this film several times since it arrived and have not been bored by it. Liam Nielsen portrays the deceptive scientist well and Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect in the part originally played by Claire Bloom.If you like spook house films, you will not be disappointed by this effort.', \" Maybe Big Brother will hate me, but...: I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them.\", ' Gorgeous!!!: This Stainless Steel & Glass Diner Cake Set is gorgeous!

There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes.

The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas?

The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others...\", ' Spanish: In description this serie specific dubbed to spanish but is not real only English language. Not subtitules in spanish.Mal mal mal. But Is very funny.', \" This is not a horror movie.: This is not a horror movie- it is an interesting science fiction movie. However, it is a science fiction movie with bad special effects and a bad dialogue. The acting is good, but that just doesn't make up for it.

I couldn\\'t put it down. The story is frightening, especially when you think about some of our current issues such as \"Homeland Security\", and the new measures the government is taking to \"protect\" us. Given the current situation in this country I think it is essential to read 1984. This book has made me rethink somethings.', ' Sorry, try again: This \"book\" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless.

How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well.\", ' The book itself gets 5 stars: ...but for the money, they need to do a better job with the footnotes in a Terry Pratchett book.

Also part of another footnote or 2 get embedded the same way...kind of ruins the effect.', \" Godd film for when you're in the mood for hotties!: No one in this film would ever win an academy award for anything, no would the film itself. That aside, you'd have to look long and hard to find a film with more T&A (good stuff) than this ones got. The movie itself and the dumb plot are childishly enjoyable. One of the most hillarious elements is the carwash owner who seems to be immune to any type of testosterone attacks despite the fact that he's got scantily clad(or not!) women running around all over the place waiting for the chance to have sex!

The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It\\'s the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a \"must see/ will change your life\" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time.', ' Excellent Enz: Although a little uneven, this release has two timeless ballads (\"Iris\" and \"One Step Ahead\") and some rollicking good time pop songs (History Never Repeats, I Don\\'t Wanna Dance, Hard Act To Follow) and the dazzling \"Ships\" which is one of my favorite Enz songs.

This movie The Whistler is NOT even a full length feature film. It is a very short 60 minute movie that someone made for next to nothing over one weekend. Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie. In all honesty this release is something I would see in a local store for $1 and I would not even give it a thought. Absolute junk and I feel ripped off.

But, I\\'m sure none of you really care!! HAHA. ATHOW is very close to being the best metal record I own. The guitar work by Abbath is bone-crushing, and the drumming by Horgh is phenominal. But, the real excellence is Peter Tagtgren\\'s production. He brings to life what these musicians are conveying. Superb. Immortal have created an amazing metal \"fantasy\" with all their records.

She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant.

Very happy with it. Thanks', \" Muddled ending disapoints: The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw.\", ' Filter compartment smaller than I thought: Love the look and quality. But coffee filters for a regular sized coffee maker do not fit in the filter compartment.', ' Orwell\\'s Greatest Work!: I have read everything Orwell has ever penned, even his essays, and this is by far his best piece of work. The efficiency of his prose, the imaginative use of language that has become part of our daily lexicon (how many times have you used the term \"Big Brother\"?). This is truly a treasure and a novel that I read at least once a year.', \" West Coast Avant Garde: Listen to the sound bite before you buy. I didn't, but I should have.

I have been a World War I aviation buff for many years. When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject. Watch this film for whatever entertainment value it may have , but not to get an idea of what World War I aerial combat was like.\", ' delightfull miniseries with low production values: this miniseries is about a young matchmaker in regancy england who gets in involved everyones business. the performance are good but the production values are horbil and the costumes are very plain. but it is pretty good and is very faitfull to jane austens classic book.', \" Another Warners Archive Collection Bust: As with They Only Kill Their Masters, another recent purchase, this DVD is from the Warners Archive Collection.

The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady.

The rest is just blank air. The lead singer emotes like a tin can and the music is a good reason why grunge is dying. This album gives us good reason why the band is named GARBAGE.', ' Not what I expected: I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud. While the Hummer MusiXstation looks amazing and has pretty good functionality, the sound quality and volume is very low. To be honest, I wish it sounded like it looked. The radio is not very good at picking up FM stations, either. It does have a Audio in jack, which was very helpful and not available on a lot of other models.I was not impressed overall, and we switched back to our 1998 boombox in the kitchen.Pros: Looks amazing, seems durable, cool features (including audio in)Cons: Not very loud, sound quality is decent at best, subwoofer is a joke, digital FM radio not very receptive', \" DON'T BUY THIS CARD IF YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE: I bought this card, and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon.com I tried to cancell it, I purchased the wrong card.

I know the purists all rave about the use of packaged prepared foods, but come on, who today has time to cook from scratch?

The effects were spectacular, but I winced several times at the cheesy dialogue and woeful exposition. The animated move from the 80's is a much better story. I'd heard that this installment was much better than the first two, but I was just as dissapointed. I also thought we might have less women walking around looking like expensive call girls with Megan Fox's exit, but there was even more gratuitous butt and boob exposure than in the others. I should have known better than to waste my 4 dollars and 2 and a half hours. Don't let your kids watch this!\", ' The Best Pocket Tripod: This Sony VCT-TK1 is by far the best pocket tripod for instant use.

It cuts through ceramic tile easily and I actually had good success using the 45 degree cutting feature, although, it's a little sloppy.Now for the bad. I had problems similar to previous readers:The fence had to be modified to fit, it is very difficult to adjust, it is not accurate (you will need to use a tape measure), and the fence stripped out after about 10 cuts so it could no longer clamp to the table.This made it effectively USELESS for accurate cutting, so my day of tiling was wasted. Oh, and tiles catch on rear blade gaurd.I am now going to try and return the saw.\", ' Its really just a harlequin novel: If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this book and in its successors.Most ridiculous thing about this series is how Ayla makes every earth-shattering discovery of this time, e.g., discovering the wheel, horseback riding, flint knives, etc., etc.', ' This is an amazing collection of folklore!!!: This book came out a long time ago.

The book doesn\\'t cover important aspects such as selective harvesting (how to keep damage on fish as low as possible so it can be released again) or treatment of fish, once it\\'s caught (swift killing, keeping, cleaning).Two thirds of the book are about baiting, with major chaptors on how to use life bait such as small fish, salamander, frogs. However, the author completely fails to address ethical concerns about this technique(\"replace your bait frequently. When a frog tires and stops kicking, it is much less effective\"), a technique that is actually forbidden in some countries because of the cruelty involved.', \" Save your money.: Talk about being disappointed!

Apparently the free version has more than its share of issues. I figured this was still reasonably priced at $0.99, so gave it a shot. It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars.

All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK.

Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did.\", \" Beautifully written and insightful perspective.: I have read and re-read this book several times. It is a lovely story and written very well. It let's us know that everyone is human and in all communities there are good things and not so good things. Take the good and leave the rest. I have drawn on some of Sue Bender's experiences with the Amish and applied them in my own life. How wonderful to be able to read about someone else's experience and feel like you are there by their side.\", \" Worst dubbing ever!: Fast beat motivating music. Average workout. But the dubbing is so bad as to be comically distracting. Might be better if you speak German, but with English dubbing, it's intolerable.\", \" Great Book!: Romeo and Juliet is a wonderful read. I loved reading every minute of it. The summaries and the explanatory notes help you understand everything about it. This is a great book and I would recommend you read this as an introduction to Shakespeare. I did and I am now going to start A Midsummer Night's Dream. Read this book! You'll love every minute of it!\", \" there was no entry for zero stars....: Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson lost his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty.\", \" Boring, boring, boring: I struggled through this book. If I hadn't had to read it for school, I would have dropped it immediately. The story is dark and unhappy, and the writing style is so flat and boring. It seems as though the author is trying to use big flowery words and stuff, but it doesn't work at all. This is a horrible book.\", ' New Technology Needs Help: The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the \"24 Hour\" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I\\'d wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs.', \" You Think the books are Creepy? Listen to the cassettes!: I remember reading these as a kid and then buying all of them a few years later. The stories were great the illustrations were creepy, and like a lot of reviews, my little brother was scared of that picture in the haunted house story. well, ok it was pretty darn ugly. This is one of those books that still gives me the chills especially fro mthose pictures? oh what a warped mind that artist had but what creative drawings they are!Now, if you think the books are scary, try listening to the cassettes. i am in my twenties and the voice of the narrator and that creepy music gives me the willies. try listening to it in a room by yourself, and see how long it takes you to run for the door! The Scary Stories and More Scary Stories cassetes (i am not kidding) it is a kid's tape and that music will creep you out. listen to it! pick up the book follow along and see how long you last!\", \" Mrs. man Vanen's Review of Nineteen Eighty-Four: After being a smart English teacher for 41 years in Venice, I've reached the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four is a vivid satire on the Russian Revolution. I read this book on the Supreme 747 PowerJet on my way to Australia. Despite being disturbed several times by male-stewardesses, I was able to tell that this was a fantastic book. It is unfortunate that this book caused the writer years of sickness and was bedridden for the remainder of his life. And that I was not included in his will. read this book!Judas man Vanen\", \" Not as advertised: My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No.\", ' Fun Read!: This book was a fun, quick read if you like question & answer advice. At times funny and kept me reading!', ' Fun swing jam session: This is a nice recording of swing and blues style guitar. Lots of fun to listen to -- like sitting in on a friendly jam session. Duke Robillard really shines on \"Avalon\" and the bluesier numbers and Herb Ellis sounds like he\\'s having fun throughout. Recommended for swing fans or those new to jazz guitar.', ' Science lover: This book is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste authors writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. It never should be used for computer science students (unless the instructor himself has no clue about the subject). This book is for people with no formal training who want to learn some random buzzwords.', \" Apple travel plugs well made: I bought the plug package made by Apple for my Mac computer. It is very cleverly made to fit well on the current adaptor and an excellent travel accessory. I only wish that it were priced more reasonably in a package for each area of the world rather than a package for plugs used in many different countries, for a price to equal that package. As I am traveling only in Western continental Europe, I do not need several of the other plugs included, which seems an unecessary expense as well as being wasteful and makes for items I don't need.\", \" Very interesting.... like nothing i have seen before: In my German class, one boy brought this movie in. I really didn't know what to expect, because most movies we see in German class are a bit old.. this one is very different, and creative. I have never seen anything so different, and imaginative. It is very well done, and interesting. Nothing that anyone should miss seeing.\", \" Fort Apache in Blu-Ray: I am very disappointed in the blu-ray edition of this movie. This disk was made in Mexico. Itdoes not have the original picture ration. It is only 1:49 I owned this movie on DVD beforeI purchased it in blu-ray. The DVD has retained the original movie display. I will probablytry to find someone who doesn't mind but I won't watch it.\", \" Pretentious Drivel: People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this.\", ' Hi-Tec Boots Altitude IV: This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend', \" Be careful - product has changed?: I bought one of these adapters about a year ago to replace the original apple charger that came with my ibook G4. The Macally worked fine for about a year then died; since it lasted as long as the pricier apple one, I decided to go ahead and get another one. The new adapter - which is listed as exactly the same product I bought the first time - is physically different, and I think is not really compatible with the ibook G4; the charger doesn't always connect firmly to the laptop. And it could be a coincidence, but in the month since I have had it my computer has started having sudden power failures when running off a/c power (but has no problems running off battery). I guess I will be shelling out for the apple adapters in future - this one seems too risky.\", ' WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?: Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn\\'t going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying \"tweet\" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you.', ' This book has been a great influence in changing my life!: This book has been the book with the most impact on me outside of the Word of God. It has practical steps and illustrations on how to acheive a close and intimate walk with God. It plainly explains that having a close walk with God is not something mystical, but is something everyone should and can experience.', \" Meh...I've had better.: I've used lots of lip and cheek stains that have had a great result, and unfortunately this is not one of them. I gave it two stars because of the price: you are getting what you pay for. The texture is really waxy and I not as natural looking as other products. It did look okay when I first put it on, but it doesn't blend incredibly well, and rubs off within a couple hours. I'd spend some more money and get something a bit higher quality.\", ' AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK: This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. \"Stopped at Stalingrad\" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book.', ' What a Lemon: I ordered Flyboys because I had seen stills of the replica Neuports and they looked fantastic! As a lover of The Blue Max I hoped that Flyboys would exceed it largley because of advances in film effects. Was I wrong or what! A dismal screenplay peppered with gung ho naf lines paying scant attention to history. The best (worst) part of the film was the romance and our hero stealing a plane to rescue the heroine and her two young charges, for which the hero recieves a medal!! Yea right! But the one scene worth of \"the skunk of the year award\" was the hero landing his plane in a shell pocked no mans land to rescue his comrade traped under his aircraft, how did he do that? Will we ever find out?Well for me The Blue Max towers above this movie despite being over 40 years its senior. Flyboys is a dog worse than Pearl Harbour yes we have the technology but that cannot make up for a very poor and purile script and wooden acting.', ' Helpful in time of loss: This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss.', ' If i had one wish...: I\\'d make this guy go for good. I was listening to the rap/R&B station just to see what crap they would play. Well, some R&B and rap is good, but this is literally the most annoying song/album this year. \"If I had one wish...If I had one wish...If I had one wish...\". I wanna kill the person who wrote this song.', ' Unbelievable!: I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!', ' expensive but well worth it.: These card holders are durable and large as well as ruggedly built. The design allows the card holder to be held or sat on a table during play.They cost more than smaller designs but for my money they are well worth it.', ' Impressive: I was greatly impressed by this book. It has opened my horizons and gives me new hope for the future. The Purdues have laid out a road map on how to live longer and feel better. They point out that age is largely a state of mind and give advice on how to make adjustments so getting older is not a terrifying idea. Thanks a lot, Purdues!', ' awesome reading: This book is the start of an incredible journey. It gives an insight to our origins in such a way that you can no longer doubt ourroots. Ayla is the epitome of all of us!', \" JUNK - don't waste your money or time!: My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!\"]\n"

            "[' This machine makes as much noise as a power tool: All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive. These guys must have used a cheap hard drive or something. I have the Amazon return slip on my desk......', \" Less substance than a Cugel novel.: Come on people! Even Jack Vance's zany Dying Earth novels (Cugel in particular) have more substance than this lackadaisical tour-de-force. Skip out on Burroughs, if you want quality sci-fi read the Demon Princes by Jack Vance...\", \" Not their best outting: I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday\", ' Florida birds: I love my nature guide to Florida birds. We have identified many birds using this invaluable tool. You can too!', \" Better than I remembered it!: Read the John Carter of Mars series back in junior high school. I remembered the violence of the culture created by ERB in that series and the concept of honor in battle, but I had forgotten that there were underlying messages relating to family values, honesty, integrity, trust, the individual's right to seek success, the strength to stand up for one's own beliefs. While the storyline definitely is somewhat thin, the book reads easily and leaves no loose ends. Didn't see the recent movie that came out based on the series; kind of glad that I didn't. It was fun venturing back into that realm of imagination that only books can provide.\", ' I just wanted Jimmy Ponder (too little guitar on this one): I couldn\\'t wait to get this CD,being a guitarist myself. Just give me straight Jimmy Ponder, not horns and other \"jazz types\". I am disappointed. Cuts two and four are the best. They are Jimmy. Too bad I couldn\\'t have listened to cuts first, I would not have bought this CD. Sorry! The cuts of just Jimmy are great though, but too few .... :(', ' Not so Funny people!: Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don\\'t think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow\\'s ensemble doesn\\'t seem to work with Sandler\\'s schtick. I loved \"Knocked Up\" and \"40 Year Old Virgin\" but there doesn\\'t seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for \"Bruno\" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I\\'m so glad I only rented it.', ' bench: The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy.', ' Great Music: This is a great music DVD I love it. Lot\\'s of rock stars and loads of songs, I am very pleased. Money well spent, If you like this DVD you will love \"A Concert For George\" that was a ten plus+++++', ' Worst band EVER!: nothing but chugga chugga beats, and exteremly repeative breakdowns and boring vocals , the worst of the worst when it comes to H.C. .']\n"
